# AI Studio setup

The Bicep does not actually create an AI Studio Hub / Project. 
1. You should go to Azure OpenAI, open there. 
2. On the Azure OpenAI, click 'explore AI Studio'
3. Create a new project
4. Go to model catalogue. 
5. Explore more models.
6. Select Phi-3.5

wrong:
- azd up does create openai resources that are not used
- azd up does not create the AI Studio Hub
