BUSINESS\n\n\n### Our Company\n\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we\nhave expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics\nand the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or\nAl, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.\n\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human\nintelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores,\nare essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of Al, in which software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve\nas the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by\nthousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding.\n\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware and systems, software, algorithms and libraries, and services to create unique value for\nthe markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture\nleveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets\nwith the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The\nlarge and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\n\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $29 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential\nto modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in computer\ngraphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU for general\npurpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as\naerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs and networking accelerate many of\nthe fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well\nsuited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of Al. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the\npace described by Moore's Law, we deliver GPU performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore's Law, giving the industry a path forward.\n\nGamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world's fastest growing\nspectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of\ngamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.\n\nResearchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to climate forecasting. With\nsupport for more than 2,500 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of\ndiscovery, from climate prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA\npowers over 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500 list.\n\nThe world's leading cloud service providers and consumer internet companies use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they\ndeliver to billions of end-users, including search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, Al assistants,\nnavigation, and cloud computing.\n\nA rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and AI software to bring automation to the\nproducts and services they build. The transportation industry is turning to our platforms for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry is leveraging\nthem for enhanced medical imaging and accelerated drug discovery; and the financial services industry is using them for fraud detection.\n\nProfessional designers use our GPUs and software to create visual effects in movies, and design buildings and products ranging from cell phones to\ncommercial aircraft.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"4\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\n\n#### Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\n\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp., or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby\nNVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited, or Arm, from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023\nreflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.\n\n\n### Our Businesses\n\nWe report our business results in two segments.\n\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and\nsolutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU, or vGPU, software for cloud-based\nvisual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.\n\nOur Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking\nand interconnect solutions; automotive Al Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; cryptocurrency\nmining processors, or CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.\n\n\n### Our Markets\n\nWe specialize in markets in which our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications.

Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration\nand virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, designers and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We\nalso enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device,\nalmost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.\n\nAdvancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view,\nAl is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and\nplanning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full\nfunctionally safe Al-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our\npartnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-\nbased hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-\nthe-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the\ncomplex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\n\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through\nlicense and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom\ndevelopment. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\n\n\n### Sales and Marketing\n\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient computing\nplatforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry\necosystems through our partner network. Our partner network incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or\nODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, ISVs, internet and cloud service providers, automotive\nmanufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.\n\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers and\nsolution architects to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that\nthe depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network's time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer\nsatisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within\neach platform.\n\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in\nthe software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our\nplatforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products\navailable to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game\ntitles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and\norganizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"8\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nAs NVIDIA's business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and complete\nsystems to software, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are\nalso sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.\n\n\n### Seasonality\n\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as consumer gaming, enterprise and cloud data centers, professional workstations,\nand automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production\nschedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third\nquarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. In fiscal year 2022, our demand exceeded our supply in several areas, and our\nrevenue did not follow historical seasonal patterns. However, there can be no assurance that these trends will continue. Our fiscal year 2022 supply-\nconstrained environment or historical seasonality trends may not repeat.\n\n\n### Manufacturing\n\nWe do not manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class\nsuppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise\nof industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality\ncontrol and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and\noperating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates\nand a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a\nresult, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. We have placed non-\ncancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future\nsupply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future.\n\nWe utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce\nour semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics,\nLLC, Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd., and Wistron Corporation to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products\nand platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., and Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd., to manufacture our standard\nand custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd.,\nKinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung\nSemiconductor, Inc., or Samsung, and SK Hynix. We often consign key components or materials such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated\ncircuit to the contract manufacturers.\n\nWe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration using test equipment\npurchased from industry-leading suppliers such as Advantest America Inc., and then ship the semiconductors to contract manufacturers, such as\nBYD Auto Co. Ltd. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party\nwarehouses in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and\ntest specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.\n\n\n### Competition\n\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe\nthat the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution\nchannels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe\nthat our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will\ndemand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect\ncompetition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide\nbetter performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among\ncompetitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\n\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI\ncomputing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre\nChannel and proprietary technologies. Some of our\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"9\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\ncompetitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer\nor technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n\u00b7 suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, such as\nAdvanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n\n\u00b7 large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their\ninternal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n\n\u00b7 suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD,\nBroadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing\nSoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n\n\u00b7 suppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as AMD, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP,\nIntel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large\ninternet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n\n#### Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing\narrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2022 to\nJune 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending\npatent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties,\norganizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold,\nincluding various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased\nprotection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\nprotection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n\u00b7 the location in which our products are manufactured;\n\n\u00b7 our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n\n\u00b7 the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n\n\u00b7 the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n\n##### Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our\nacquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory\nchallenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material impact on our business. On February 8, 2022, we announced the\ntermination of the Share Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the\ncompletion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and\nregulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not\ncurrently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations,\nincluding, but not limited to, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption,\nbusiness acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, competition and antitrust, advertising,\nemployment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety requirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change,\ncryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, impact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact\non our business, financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. Refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of these\npotential impacts.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"10\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n### Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance\n\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. We integrate sound environmental, social and corporate\ngovernance, or ESG, principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our\nBoard of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our practices concerning ESG. We undertake an annual analysis to\nensure that our ESG priorities remain aligned with stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are\nimportant for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders.\n\nThe following section provides an overview of some of these principles and practices. More information can be found on the Corporate Social\nResponsibility section of our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, or CSR Report. Information contained on our website\nor in our annual CSR Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or\nthe SEC. Refer to \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related to ESG.\n\n\n### Climate Change\n\nIn the area of sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, including current and emerging\nregulations and market impacts.\n\nIn our CSR Report, we report several metrics related to our environmental impact, our most recent full reporting year being fiscal year 2021, with our\nfiscal year 2022 metrics expected to be published in May 2022. There has been no material impact to capital expenditures, our results of operations\nor competitive position associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal\nyear 2025, our goal is to purchase or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data\ncenters.\n\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy\nefficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPUs are inherently more energy efficient than other forms of\ncomputing because they are optimized for throughput and performance per watt rather than absolute performance. GPU servers are approximately\n40x more energy efficient than traditional CPU servers for Al workloads. The power efficiency of our products is evidenced by our continued strong\npresence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 23 of the top 25 systems on the November 2021 Green500 list.\n\nWe plan to build Earth-2, an AI supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change. The system will build a digital twin of the Earth\non our Omniverse platform, enable scientists to do ultra-high-resolution climate modeling, and put mitigation and adaptation tools into the hands of\ncities and nations so they can act with more urgency.\n\n\n### Human Capital Management\n\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of January 30,\n2022, we had 22,473 employees in 32 countries. 16,242 were engaged in research and development and 6,231 were engaged in sales, marketing,\noperations, and administrative positions.\n\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified\nexecutives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\n\n\n### Recruitment\n\nThe demand for talent in new markets such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. With differentiated hiring strategies for university,\nprofessional, executive, and for diversity, we have been successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA.\n\nWe attract global talent from universities, collaborations with college programs, professional organization affiliations, industry conferences,\ncommunity resource group participation, direct sourcing and outreach. Our employees play an important part in recruiting, with over 39% of our new\nhires coming from employee referrals.\n\n\n### Development and Retention\n\nTo support employee advancement, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training programs, one on one coaching and ongoing\nfeedback. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We\ncurate learning paths focused on our most common\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"11\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\ndevelopment needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current programs and technologies\navailable. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We encourage internal mobility\nthrough career coaching that advises employees on developmental activities and pursuing internal transfer opportunities. We have implemented\nspecifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure\nwidespread readiness for future advancement.\n\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys\nhelp us gain insight into employee experience and provide ideas so that we can prioritize areas to take action. The suggestion box is an always-on,\ninteractive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is\ndesigned to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, our overall turnover rate was 4.9%.\n\n\n### Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\n\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company's future. Employees receive\nequity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while\nsimultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.\n\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees' and their families' physical health, well-being and financial health, including 401(k)\nprograms in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and\nprograms to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to\nproviding tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for\nnew birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.\n\n\n### Diversity and Inclusion\n\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of\ngender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.\n\nWe have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the\ntechnology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.\n\nOther efforts we have been or are undertaking include:\n\n\u00b7 Expanded recruiting teams and deepened our college pipeline to engage more diverse students and partnering with minority-serving\ninstitutions and professional organizations;\n\n\u00b7 Supported the development of women employees to build a pipeline of future leaders;\n\n\u00b7 Supported underrepresented employees through our 11 internal community resource groups;\n\n\u00b7 Providing training and education to managers and peers on how to foster a supportive environment; and\n\n\u00b7 Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, our global workforce was 80% male, 19% female, and 1% not declared and 6% of our workforce in the United States was\ncomposed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\n\n\n### Health and COVID-19\n\nWe support our people and their families in making their health and safety a top priority. During fiscal year 2022 and the COVID-19 pandemic, we\ncontinued our global protocols to keep our workforce safe. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we maintained appropriate safety\nprotocols and social distancing guidelines. We have also made some of our offices accessible based on a clearly defined set of metrics while\nadhering to government guidelines. Steps we took to support employees include:\n\n\u00b7 Providing work from home support, including reimbursement for home office equipment and certain work from home expenses;\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"12\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\u00b7 Enhanced health coverage, including-COVID-19 testing, vaccine costs and support, expanded mental health resources and virtual care\nofferings, and care for those with COVID-19;\n\n\u00b7 Learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely; and\n\n\u00b7 Opportunities for employees to socially connect with one another virtually.\n\nWe will continue a flexible work environment and have instituted Company-wide \"rest days\" for employees to recharge.\n\n\n#### Information About Our Executive Officers\n\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of March 11, 2022:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Position</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jen-Hsun Huang</td>\n<td>59</td>\n<td>President and Chief Executive Officer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colette M.

The SEC's website, http://www.sec.gov, contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information\nregarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our web site and the information on it or connected to it are not a part of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\n\n\n## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the\nfollowing risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you\nmay lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are\nimmaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\n\n\n### Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets\n\n\n#### If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\n\nOur accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. These markets\nexperience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and industry standards.\n\nOur strategic and business success depends on our ability to:\n\n\u00b7 timely identify emerging industry changes, and develop new or enhance existing products, services and technologies that meet the evolving\nneeds of these markets;\n\n\u00b7 expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies;\n\n\u00b7 accurately forecast demand in our businesses;\n\n\u00b7 meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change;\n\n\u00b7 manage product, software, and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction;\n\n\u00b7 develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including related to our acquisitions, customer support, e-commerce and IP licensing\ncapabilities; and\n\n\u00b7 complete technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments for some of the above activities.\n\nWe make considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history,\nwhich may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if they do not\nbecome widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nAchieving design wins, which is important to our success in several businesses, may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to\nanticipate features and functionality that customers will demand. Unanticipated changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation\ncould render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry\nand safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Failure to obtain a particular design win may\nprevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. Furthermore, a design win does not guarantee revenue.\n\nWe cannot ensure that our strategic direction will result in products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail to\nanticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market\nconditions evolve, our business will be harmed.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"14\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n### Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry\nstandards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors' products, services and technologies, such as the high-end discrete\nGPUs offered by Intel and AMD, may be cheaper or provide better functionality or features than ours, which may result in lower than expected\nselling prices for our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer\nbases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, new designs and more design wins, and greater financial, sales, marketing and\ndistribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and\nend user customer trends, more quickly transition their products, and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials during a supply-\nconstrained environment, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch\nsuppliers and have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such\ncustomers entails the transfer of IP rights that may enable such customers to develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. If we\nare unable to successfully compete and respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive\nenvironment, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline.\n\n\n### Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\n\n\n#### If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, there may be a mismatch between supply and demand, and our financial results could be harmed.\n\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product releases\nand announcements, competing technologies, and other factors, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. We sell many of our\nproducts through channel partners, who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners,\nretailers and distributors in response to changing market conditions and demand for our products could impact our ability to properly forecast\ndemand.\n\nGPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based\nplatforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency\nmining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and\nchanges in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our\nproducts, and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but\nnot limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket\nresales of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution channel, and may reduce demand for our\nnew GPUs. We have introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP\nin an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. However, if attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities\nof our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, increasing demand for our gaming GPUs and limiting our\nability to supply our gaming cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will achieve our\ndesired outcome. In addition, our products may be resold on the unauthorized \"gray market,\" which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray\nmarket products compete with our distribution channels.\n\nConsumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center, and workstation\nproducts, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand. These challenges may continue in the future when the effects of the pandemic\nsubside.\n\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of\ncustomers' future demand. We have revised our process for purchasing supply as a result of the worldwide supply shortages impacting the\nsemiconductor industry. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future quarters and long-term supply and\ncapacity needs. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess\ninventory. Demand for our products may be perishable or may disappear, which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause us to\nlose market share, perhaps permanently. To shorten shipment lead times, we may build finished products and carry inventory for anticipated\ndemand that does not materialize. We may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments if customers cancel or defer orders or\nchoose to purchase from our competitors. We may write-down our\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"15\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\ninventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we\nincorrectly forecast product demand.\n\nSituations that may result in excess inventory or related impairments include:\n\n\u00b7 changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in our target markets\nand/or overall economy and changes in the credit market;\n\n\u00b7 higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\n\u00b7 new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases;\n\n\u00b7 increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\n\u00b7 fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or\n\n\u00b7 decrease in future demand, decrease in the cost of supply chain materials, or changes in the design of future products where we have\nentered into long-term supply commitments, including prepayments, particularly to the extent we are placing orders well in advance of our\nhistorical lead times and/or before the design of those products is final.\n\nConversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints\ncaused by natural disasters or other events. If we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a\ncost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we\ncould lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.\n\nIn periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we are in today, we have\nplaced and may continue to place non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of our historical lead times, and pay premiums and/or provide\ndeposits to secure future supply and capacity. For example, while we previously placed orders with approximately six months' lead time, we have\nbegun placing orders at least twelve months in advance. Our inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for our future\nquarters and long-term supply and capacity needs. However, we may not be able to accurately predict when such periods of shortage will end, nor\ndo we know whether those inventory orders accurately address our current and future demand needs. These actions may increase our product\ncosts and trigger significant excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if\nsuch demand is served by our competitors, which could negatively impact our gross margins and our overall financial results.\n\nWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products, which reduces our\ncontrol over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could\nharm our business.\n\nWe do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries to\nmanufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products, but\ninstead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and\nverification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for greater functionality from\nour products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we may enter into long-term supply and capacity\ncommitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs. We face several risks which could\nadversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and\nservices, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\n\u00b7 lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from\nincorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n\n\u00b7 failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test capacity\nfor our products;\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"16\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n. failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller\ngeometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products;\n\n\u00b7 limited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;\n\n\u00b7 loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing\nvolume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;\n\n\u00b7 lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\n\n\u00b7 delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries\nprioritize our competitors' orders over ours; and\n\n\u00b7 low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry's proprietary process technology.\n\n\n##### If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.\n\nOur hardware and software product offerings are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or\nunsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may\nincrease as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. Some errors in\nour products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products\nor services could expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack\nour products or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the\nproduct in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any\nsuch defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the\nvalue of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.\nAn error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to\nachieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and\nconsumers' perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results.\nWe may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in the field. If a product\nliability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management\npersonnel and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable\nterms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\n\n\n### Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business\n\n\n#### We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business.\n\nWe conduct our business and have offices worldwide. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third\nparties located outside of the United States and we generated 84% of our revenue for fiscal year 2022 from sales outside of the United States. The\nglobal nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, including:\n\n\u00b7 domestic and international economic and political conditions between countries in which we do business;\n\n\u00b7 differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices;\n\n\u00b7 domestic and international business and cultural practices that differ;\n\n\u00b7 disruptions to capital markets and/or currency fluctuations; and\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"17\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n##### \u00b7 natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.\n\nAdverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary,\nor trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in\nunemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. More recently, increased inflation may impact supply, employee,\nfacilities and infrastructure costs. To the extent such inflation continues, increases or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse\neffect on our financial performance.\n\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including:\n\n\u00b7 decrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers or licensees;\n\n\u00b7 the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us;\n\n\u00b7 our customers' or our licensees' inability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\n\n\u00b7 the insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers or licensees;\n\n\u00b7 limits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n\n\u00b7 difficulties in obtaining capital;\n\n\u00b7 reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for\nbankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations;\n\n. lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete\neffectively; and\n\n\u00b7 increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts\non our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our\nfinancial instruments.\n\nWe have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing located in Israel. The State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have\nbeen and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott. Other countries have and may continue in the future restrict business with the State\nof Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Such laws and policies may have adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n\n\n### Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\n\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors. Water and energy\navailability and reliability in the communities where we conduct business is critical. We have facilities in regions that may be vulnerable to the\nimpacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry conditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs\ndue to wildfire risk. These measures can have adverse implications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including\nimpairing the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide, and its\npotential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may disrupt our business and\nmay cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we maintain a program of insurance\ncoverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost.\nSome of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses\nnot covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur operations, products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and\nlawsuits. Regulations such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated\nwith changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased levels of capital\nexpenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce emissions, as well as greater indirect costs\nresulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could\nharm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"18\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\noperations and product design activities. Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and\ntherefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from\nrenewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a\ngoal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in\nincreased litigation and costs.\n\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. We may face decreased demand for\ncomputationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient design and operation, and/or increased\nconsumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.\n\n\n### We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\n\nWe have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or\nenhance our existing strategic objectives.\n\nAcquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell\nour products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, if we pursue a particular\ntransaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely\ncomplete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we\nmay not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes\ncan take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8,\n2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from\nSoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to\nrecord in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at\nsigning in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions\nmay be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results\nand may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\n\nRisks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u00b7 difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business;\n\n\u00b7 diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;\n\n\u00b7 assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n\n\u00b7 integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\n\u00b7 coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\n\u00b7 difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\n\n\u00b7 difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing;\n\n\u00b7 Stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to\nclose an acquisition;\n\n\u00b7 legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\n\n\u00b7 potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\ncovenants or other restrictions;\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"19\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\u00b7 the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\n\u00b7 the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n\n\u00b7 negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n\n\u00b7 potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are\nacquiring; and\n\n\u00b7 impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target's employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or\ninvestment.\n\n\n#### System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.\n\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or\nhardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult\nto successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.\n\nFor example, on February 23, 2022, we became aware of a security incident involving unauthorized access to our network by a group of\nindependent criminal threat actors, not affiliated with any government or political cause. The threat actors obtained NVIDIA network credentials and\nthrough deception, obtained two-factor authentication capability and access to our network. The threat actors misappropriated certain NVIDIA\nproprietary information, including NVIDIA source code, and leaked some of that information online. Upon learning of the security incident, we\nengaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all NVIDIA network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access, hardened our network,\nanalyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and notified law enforcement and other authorities.\n\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become\nmore prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if\nrestoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\n\nThreat actors, sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks.\nDue to increasing geopolitical conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks.\nFurthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without\nlimitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-\nchain attacks or other business disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners' supply\nchains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our\ninformation technology systems, including our products and services, or the third-party information technology systems that support our services.\nOur ability to monitor these third parties' information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in\nplace. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security breach, our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not\nhave direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security breach.\n\nTo defend against cyber-attacks, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is\nexpected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security\nmeasures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers. We may not always be able to detect vulnerabilities in\nour security controls, systems or software, including third-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and\nmay not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures\ndesigned to address identified vulnerabilities.\n\nBreaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or\nsensitive or confidential data about us or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information,\npotentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our\nbusiness. If we or a third party we rely on experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may\nexperience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, restrictions on\nprocessing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of funds, financial\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"20\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nloss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and\nservices, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill orders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could\nadversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\n\n\n### Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\n\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications\nfailures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions,\nepidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our\ncurrent data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business\noperations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as\nearthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-\nparty vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic\npolitical developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or\nadverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. For example, the invasion by Russia of Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on our\nemployees or operations both within and outside these regions, and may result in the loss of some or even all of our assets in those regions. Our\noperations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including\nnatural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,\nenvironmental, public health, or political issues. For example, our operations could be harmed, and our costs could increase, if the conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine results in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The\nultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In\nthe event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of\ndeclines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions\ncould materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n\n\n### We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these\ndistributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our\npartner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to\npurchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because\nmost of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no\nnotice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our\ncompetitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which may\nalter partners' or customers' purchasing patterns. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability\nto sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n\n\n### If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\n\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and\nrecruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry's highly competitive market\nfor skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and develop diverse\ntalent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our business may be adversely\naffected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. We also must retain the key\npersonnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent on the\nservices of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving\nexecutives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"21\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n#### Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\n\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over\nfinancial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical and they\nneed to be scalable to support our growth, including for acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 to\ncommence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP\nsystem problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our\nbusiness or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose\nsubstantial demands on management time. Failure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could\nharm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\n\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause investors to lose confidence in\nour financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and if\nwe fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our\nability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted,\nthe trading price of our common stock may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\n\n\n#### The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCOVID-19 has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. As\nthe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and the limited availability of\nour supply chain and logistical services, may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. While COVID-19 has driven\nan increase in sales for certain of our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. COVID-19 containment around the world\nhas put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support operations could limit our capacity to meet customer\ndemand. Stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, which could increase our costs, limit\nour ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all, or cause us to hold excess inventory if demand changes.\n\nCOVID-19's effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and may continue to result in,\ndisruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact\noverall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.\n\nWe have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as required by government\nregulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to\nmitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. When we begin to reopen our offices, we\nexpect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite services and related in-office costs.\n\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business\nstrategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and access to sources of liquidity and financial\ncondition, though the full extent and duration of these impacts is uncertain.\n\n\n### Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\n\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors described in these risk factors. Therefore,\ninvestors should not rely on past comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Additional factors that could\naffect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n\n\u00b7 our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\u00b7 our ability to comply with our customers' contractual obligations;\n\n. the inability of some customers to make required payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to\nthese customers, and customer bad debt write-offs;\n\n\u00b7 unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\n\n\u00b7 changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\n\nAny one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our\nexpectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.\n\n\n#### Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\n\n\n##### Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other actions may adversely impact our business.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and\ninfringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash\nrepatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity;\nenvironmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with\nsuch requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may impact our business operations negatively. For\nexample, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices.\nThere can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have\ndesigned to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us,\nour officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and\nregulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to\nmanufacture our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in\nanti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over\nconcentration of economic power in corporations.\n\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export\nregulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect\nour ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce's U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and\ngenerally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the Russian invasion of\nUkraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional sanctions\nor export control measures, which have and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete restrictions on exports to and other\ncommerce and business dealings involving Russia, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or\nblocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and support into Russia or other regions determined to be\nsupporting Russia, and restrict access by our Russian or Ukrainian employees (both within and outside of Russia and Ukraine) to our systems,\nnegatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign government\nbodies, we recently ceased product sales to Russia. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade\nrestrictions, our employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may\nbe ultimately held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated U.S. export control laws, we may be subject to various penalties available\nunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally,\nchanges in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and\nresults of operations.\n\nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea where the manufacture of our\nproduct components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export\ncontrols, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and\nprofitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of Al technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target products\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"23\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nand services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions could limit our ability\nto serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and financial results. Deemed export control limitations could negatively impact\nthe ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner.\n\nRecent restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming\nbusiness. Additionally, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the\nimposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect\non our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments.\n\n\n### Issues relating to the responsible use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.\n\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services, may result in reputational harm\nand liability, and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our products and\nservices. Al presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. Al poses emerging ethical issues and if we\nenable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, or if we are unable to develop effective internal\npolicies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of Al models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may\nexperience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Compliance with government regulation in the area of Al ethics may also\nincrease the cost of related research and development. Our failure to address concerns relating to the responsible use of Al by us or others could\nundermine public confidence in Al and slow adoption of Al in our products and services or cause reputational harm.\n\n\n### Increased scrutiny from shareholders and others regarding our environmental, social and governance responsibilities could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us.\n\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have focused\nincreasingly on the ESG and sustainability practices of companies, including those associated with climate change and human rights. These parties\nhave placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet shareholder or other\nindustry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and business activities may be negatively\nimpacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosures we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of\nsocial and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital\nmanagement, product quality, supply chain management, and talent diversity and inclusion practices. It is possible that stakeholders may not be\nsatisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor,\nreport, and comply with various ESG practices, or choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue or not expand business\nwith existing customers, due to our policies. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure\ncould have a material negative impact on our reputation and business activities.\n\n\n### Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our\nemployees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling could include significant damages,\ninvalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes\ninfringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and\nthey may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.\n\nWe may commence legal proceedings in order to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our\noperating results. We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a\nthird party's IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party's IP rights. However, we may not be able to obtain\nlicenses at all or on terms acceptable to us. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license, we could be subject to substantial\nliabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other\npayments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nterms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating\nexpenses which could negatively impact our operating results.\n\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the\ncountries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This\nmakes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other\nconfidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our\ninvestment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees\nare hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and\ntechnologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to\nenforce such protections.\n\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligations. Privacy concerns relating to our products and services\ncould damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, or result in legal or regulatory\nproceedings and liability.\n\nOur products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security\nlaws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us\nand on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our\nreputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could\nresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to\ndefending legal claims.\n\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union\nadopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling\nof personal data of persons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and\nthe ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be\nsubject to penalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and individuals may initiate litigation related to our\nprocessing of their personal data. Furthermore, there exists a proposed European regulation related to Al that, if adopted, could impose onerous\nobligations and could require us to change our business practices.\n\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts\nthe transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of \"Standard Contractual Clauses\" designed\nfor entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level\nof protection, including the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and\nlocal personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. The inability to import personal data to\nthe United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to\nEuropean and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere\nat significant expense.\n\nThe United States federal, state and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach\nnotification, personal data privacy, and consumer protection. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, gives California residents the\nright to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and\nshared. The CCPA allows for statutory fines of up to $7,500 per violation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches.\nCalifornia's privacy laws will further expand in 2023 under the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, which may restrict the use of certain\ncategories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; restrict the retention of personal\ninformation; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to\nimpose administrative fines. Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ\nfrom the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we become subject to new data privacy laws the risk of enforcement action against us could\nincrease as we become subject to additional obligations.\n\nThe interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are quickly changing and may\nbe interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\ninconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to\nthose of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to\ncomply with such obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could\nface significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or\noversight, bans on processing personal data and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse\neffect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.\n\n\n### We have exposure to tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.\n\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net\nworth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax\nliabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our\nworldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example,\nwe are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in Germany, Israel and\nIndia. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse\noutcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our\nbusiness, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal and state or international\ntax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes, including proposed changes to existing tax rules and regulations\nunder the current U.S. administration and Congress and as a result of recommendations from intergovernmental economic organizations such as\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced\nin fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA. Starting in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to\ncapitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen\nyears. If Congress does not modify or repeal this provision, it will materially reduce our cash flows beginning in fiscal year 2023. Furthermore, recent\nproposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate or impose a minimum tax on financial statement income, increase U.S. taxation of\ninternational business operations and impose a global minimum tax, could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates. Numerous countries, as\nwell as organizations such as the OECD, support the global minimum tax initiative and are considering changes to existing tax laws or have\nproposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate\nour business, which could materially impact our results of operations.\n\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are\ndetermined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax\npurposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of\nexisting laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies\nwithin the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of\nearnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or\ninternational organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in\nour effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\n\n\n### Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\n\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving\nshareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of\na securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders seeking to assert claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading\nstatements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory\nproceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from\nmanufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of\npatents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and\noverall trends. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Our business is subject to laws\nand\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"26\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nregulations that are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy\nviolations of, these laws and regulations.\n\n\n### Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of $11 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes matures, unless earlier\nredeemed or repurchased, we have to repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may be required to do so on different or less\nfavorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition. We also have a $575\nmillion commercial paper program.\n\nMaintenance of our indebtedness and contractual restrictions, and future issuances of indebtedness could cause us to dedicate a substantial portion\nof our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in\ngeneral economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\nimpair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and restrict\nour ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, or materially change our business.\n\nWe are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our indenture and our ability to comply may be affected by events beyond our control. If\nwe breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared\nimmediately due and payable. Changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities,\nrestrict our ability to obtain financing in the future and affect the terms of any such financing.\n\n\n### Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.\n\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent\na change in control. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a\nmajority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock, change\nthe number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder approval; the inability of our shareholders to act by\nwritten consent or to call special meetings; advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority\nvoting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. In 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft to\ndevelop and sell graphics chips and license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if someone\nmakes an offer to purchase at least 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to\npurchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it more difficult for\nshareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.\n\n\n## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n### ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur headquarters is in Santa Clara, California. We own and lease approximately 1.76 million square feet of office and building space for our\ncorporate headquarters. We have a new building at our Santa Clara campus which was completed in February 2022. In addition, we lease data\ncenter space in Santa Clara, California. We also own and lease facilities for data centers, research and development, and/or sales and\nadministrative purposes throughout the U.S. and in various international locations, primarily in Asia, Israel, and Europe. We believe our existing\nfacilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. We do not identify or allocate assets by\noperating segment. For additional information regarding obligations under leases, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n### ITEM 3.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n\n# PART II\n\n\n## ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January\n22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of March 11, 2022, we had approximately 313 registered shareholders,\nnot including those shares held in street or nominee name.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock, such that each stockholder of record at the close of business on June\n21, 2021 received a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, or the Stock Split. All share, equity\naward, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock\nSplit.\n\n\n### Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\n\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion\nthrough January 30, 2022.\n\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be\nmade in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market\nconditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common\nstock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.\n\nWe did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022. As of January 30, 2022, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to\nrepurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under\nthat program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the\nbest interests of our shareholders.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of all existing 349 million treasury shares. Refer to Note\n15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the\nretirement of our treasury shares.\n\n\n#### Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding\n\nWe withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock\nunit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2022, we withheld approximately 8 million shares for a total value of\n$1.90 billion through net share settlements. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to\nadditional paid-in capital, with withheld shares assuming the status of authorized and unissued shares. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive\nplans.\n\n\n##### Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds\n\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we issued a total of 175,333 shares of our common stock as consideration in connection with acquisitions, all in private\ntransactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2), Regulation D, or\nRegulation S.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"28\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n### Stock Performance Graphs\n\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the\nfive years ended January 30, 2022.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\",\nour Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\n\n\n### Overview\n\n\n#### Our Company and Our Businesses\n\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we\nhave expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics\nand the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV,\nrobotics, AR and VR.\n\nOur two operating segments are \"Graphics\" and \"Compute & Networking.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nPart IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\n\n### Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\n\n\n#### Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\n\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We\nintend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided\nat signing in September 2020.\n\n\n#### Demand\n\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions, competitor product releases and\nannouncements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to\ntheir designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for\nus to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of\ncryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in\ncryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, and new cryptocurrency standards can impact and have impacted in the past\ncryptocurrency demand, and further impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency\nstandards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining\nand may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase returns of our products in the distribution\nchannel, and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. We have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and\nincreased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year\n2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts\nin the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners,\nand therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot predict whether our strategy of using LHR cards and CMP will\nachieve our desired outcome. Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to\nestimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on\nboth a global and regional basis. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be\nincorrect.\n\n\n#### Supply\n\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of\ncustomers' future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or\nexcess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. To\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nhave shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build finished products and maintain inventory for\nanticipated periods of growth which do not occur, anticipating demand that does not materialize, or for what we believe is pent-up demand. During\nfiscal year 2022, we made substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. We expect to\nremain supply-constrained into the first half of fiscal year 2023, primarily in Gaming and Networking. We have placed non-cancellable inventory\norders for certain supply in advance of our historical lead times, paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may\nneed to continue to do so in the future. Ordering product in advance of our historical lead times to secure supply in a constrained environment may\ntrigger excess inventory or other charges if there is a partial or complete reduction in long-term demand for our products or if such demand is served\nby our competitors. Given our long lead times on inventory purchasing, demand may be perishable or may disappear. Given our current long lead\ntimes, we may order components before our product design is finalized and changes to the product design or end demand could trigger excess\ninventory. Our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year which could cause changes to expected revenue or cash\nflows.\n\n\n### COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued during fiscal year 2022. Most of our employees continue to work remotely and we have paused most business\ntravel. During fiscal year 2022, our Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as\npeople continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstations as\nenterprises support hybrid work environments. As our offices begin to reopen, we expect to incur incremental expenses as we resume onsite\nservices and related in-office costs.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers, the availability of supply chain, logistical services and\ncomponent supply, and the impact of rising inflation may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.\n\nWe believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper arrangements, will be sufficient\nto satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our\nexisting operations.\n\n\n### Fiscal Year 2022 Summary\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"3\">Year Ended</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n<th>Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">($ in millions, except per share data)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td>$ 26,914</td>\n<td>$ 16,675</td>\n<td>Up 61%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross margin</td>\n<td>64.9 %</td>\n<td>62.3 %</td>\n<td>Up 260 bps</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating expenses</td>\n<td>$ 7,434</td>\n<td>$ 5,864</td>\n<td>Up 27%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income from operations</td>\n<td>$ 10,041</td>\n<td>$ 4,532</td>\n<td>Up 122%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income</td>\n<td>$ 9,752</td>\n<td>$ 4,332</td>\n<td>Up 125%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income per diluted share</td>\n<td>$ 3.85</td>\n<td>$ 1.73</td>\n<td>Up 123%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our\nexpertise is critical: Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.\n\nRevenue for fiscal year 2022 was $26.91 billion, up 61% from a year ago.\n\nGaming revenue was up 61% from a year ago reflecting higher sales of GeForce GPUs. We continue to benefit from strong demand for NVIDIA\nAmpere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination of factors, including:\nthe ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming, esports, content creation\nand streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end users to engage in\ncryptocurrency mining.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"31\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nAlthough nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are LHR to help direct GeForce GPUs to gamers, our GPUs are\ncapable of cryptocurrency mining. Gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency using our GPUs, although we have limited visibility\ninto how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies or\nmethod of verifying transactions, such as proof of work or proof of stake, can impact demand for our products and degrade our ability to accurately\nestimate it. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future.\n\nData Center revenue was up 58% from a year ago primarily driven by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture GPUs across both training and inference\nfor cloud computing and AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep recommender models.\n\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 100% from a year ago driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand\nfor workstations as enterprises support hybrid work environments, as well as growth in workloads such as 3D design, Al and rendering.\n\nAutomotive revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to self-driving and AI cockpit solutions offset by a decline in legacy cockpit revenue.\n\nOEM and Other revenue was up 84% from a year ago primarily driven by CMP sales. CMP revenue was $550 million for the fiscal year and was\nnominal in the prior year.\n\nRevenue for our CMP products declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. We are unable to estimate with any degree of precision\nthe impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market, as discussed above, is likely to have on future CMP sales.\n\nGross margin for fiscal year 2022 was up 260 basis points from a year ago driven by lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-\nrecurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. Margins also benefited from a higher-end mix within Gaming, partially offset by\na mix shift within Data Center.\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2022 were up 27% from a year ago primarily driven by stock-based compensation, compensation-related costs\nassociated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\n\nIncome from operations was $10.04 billion, up 122% from a year ago. Net income and net income per diluted share were $9.75 billion and $3.85, up\n125% and 123%, respectively, from a year ago.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $21.21 billion, up from $11.56 billion a year earlier. The increase reflects operating cash flow\ngeneration and $5.00 billion of debt issuance proceeds.\n\nWe paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2022.\n\n\n### Market Platform Highlights\n\nAt our November 2021 GPU Technology Conference, we announced general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise; 65 new and updated\nsoftware development kits, including NVIDIA Riva, Modulus, ReOpt, Morpheus, cuNumeric, and Clara Holoscan; NVIDIA Quantum-2 400Gbps\nswitch and end-to-end networking platform; and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge AI and autonomous machines.\n\nIn our Gaming platform during fiscal year 2022, we further expanded our desktop and laptop Geforce RTX 30 Series GPU line-ups; expanded the\nRTX ecosystem of games and applications to over 240; announced plans to integrate NVIDIA DLSS into the Unity game engine; and introduced a\nnew high-performance membership tier to GeForce NOW.\n\nIn our Data Center platform, we launched new NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs for mainstream AI, data analytics and graphics; debuted a new class of\nNVIDIA-Certified Systems with leading server OEMs; unveiled NVIDIA Grace, our first Arm-based data center CPU; launched the NVIDIA AI\nEnterprise software suite; unveiled the NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command Al software offerings; and announced plans to build Earth-2, an\nAI supercomputer dedicated to addressing the global climate change crisis.\n\nIn our Professional Visualization platform, we unveiled NVIDIA RTX GPUs for next-generation notebook and desktop workstations; and launched\nNVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise for collaborative 3D design, digital twins and virtual worlds and NVIDIA Omniverse for Creators.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"32\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nIn our Automotive platform, we unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan next-generation SOC; announced design wins with Mercedes-Benz for the AI\ncockpit in its new EQS sedan; with Volvo Cars for the autonomous driving computer in its next-generation cars, beginning with the XC90 in 2022;\nwith energy vehicles from R-Auto, IM Motors, NIO, Faraday Future, VinFast and Xpeng; with robotaxis including Cruise, Amazon Zoox, Pony.ai and\nAutoX; with autonomous trucking companies Embark, Kodiak Robotics and Plus; formed a multi-year partnership with Jaguar Land Rover to jointly\ndevelop and deliver next-generation automated driving systems, plus AI-enabled services and experiences; and announced that Desay, Flex,\nQuanta, Valeo and ZF are using the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform to manufacture safe and secure AV systems for vehicle makers.\n\n\n### Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue,\nexpenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue\nrecognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the\nAudit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and\nestimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n### Inventories\n\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost\nof sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of\nour inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\n\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions,\nsudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements,\nnew product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand due to unexpected end use cases, failure\nto estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in\ndemand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding\nexcess inventory.\n\nThe overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 0.9%\nin fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory\nbased on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our\nmanufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend on to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of\ncustomers' future demand. We place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain products in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums\nand provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by\nour competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\n\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud\nservices. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract (where revenue is\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"33\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each\nperformance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n\n\n### Product Sales Revenue\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect\nto receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware,\nand/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at\nthe time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed\nhistorical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\n\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and\nmarketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are\ndesigned to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and\naccrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n\n### License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we\nrecognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which\nthe development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the\nestimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\n\n\n#### Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal\nyear by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects\nattributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of\nany tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the\napplication of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an\nanticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the\nrecorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense\nin our financial statements accordingly.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management\ndetermined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain\njurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the\ntechnical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"34\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\n\n\n#### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist,\nusing either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the\ngoodwill resides to its carrying value. As of January 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.35 billion and the amount of goodwill\nallocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $361 million and $3.99 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a\nreporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and\nassumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be\nreasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\n\nWe performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was\nno goodwill impairment.\n\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\n\n\n### Results of Operations\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is presented below. A\ndiscussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 can be found under Item 7 in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021, which is available free of\ncharge on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of\nrevenue.\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">Year Ended</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td>100.0 %</td>\n<td>100.0 %</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost of revenue</td>\n<td>35.1</td>\n<td>37.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross profit</td>\n<td>64.9</td>\n<td>62.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating expenses:</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Research and development</td>\n<td>19.6</td>\n<td>23.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sales, general and administrative</td>\n<td>8.0</td>\n<td>11.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total operating expenses</td>\n<td>27.6</td>\n<td>35.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income from operations</td>\n<td>37.3</td>\n<td>27.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interest income</td>\n<td>0.1</td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interest expense</td>\n<td>(0.9)</td>\n<td>(1.1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other, net</td>\n<td>0.4</td>\n<td>0.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other income (expense), net</td>\n<td>(0.4)</td>\n<td>(0.7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income before income tax expense</td>\n<td>36.9</td>\n<td>26.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income tax expense</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income</td>\n<td>36.2 %</td>\n<td>26.0 %</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"35\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n### Revenue\n\n\n#### Revenue by Reportable Segments\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"4\">Year Ended</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n<th>$ Change</th>\n<th>% Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">($ in millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Graphics</td>\n<td>$ 15,868</td>\n<td>$ 9,834</td>\n<td>$ 6,034</td>\n<td>61 %</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Compute &amp; Networking</td>\n<td>11,046</td>\n<td>6,841</td>\n<td>4,205</td>\n<td>61 %</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 26,914</td>\n<td>$ 16,675</td>\n<td>$ 10,239</td>\n<td>61 %</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nGraphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. We continue to benefit from strong\ndemand for NVIDIA Ampere architecture products, and believe the increase in Gaming revenue during fiscal year 2022 resulted from a combination\nof factors, including: the ramp of new RTX 30 Series GPUs; the release of new games supporting ray tracing; the rising popularity of gaming,\nesports, content creation and streaming; the demand for new and upgraded systems to support the increase in remote work; and the ability of end\nusers to engage in cryptocurrency mining.\n\nCompute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 61% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, driven\nprimarily by sales of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products to hyperscale customers for cloud computing and workloads such as natural language\nprocessing and deep recommender models, as well as to vertical industries. The increase compared to fiscal year 2021 also reflects the strong\nsales of networking products and that fiscal year 2022 includes a full year of networking revenue as Mellanox was acquired in April 2020. CMP\ncontributed $550 million in fiscal year 2022 compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year.\n\n\n### Concentration of Revenue\n\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 81% of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if\nthe revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.\n\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\n\n#### Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors,\nincluding wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-\nbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.\n\nOur overall gross margin was 64.9% and 62.3% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to\nlower Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase also\nbenefited from a higher-end mix within Graphics, partially offset by a mix shift within Compute & Networking.\n\nInventory provisions totaled $354 million and $116 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously\nwritten-off or written-down totaled $111 million and $145 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our\ngross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.9% in fiscal year 2022 and insignificant in fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to higher-end mix\nwithin GeForce GPUs.\n\nThe gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during fiscal year 2022 when compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a\nshift in product mix and partially offset by a reduced contribution from Automotive solutions.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"36\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n### Operating Expenses\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"4\">Year Ended</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n<th>Change $</th>\n<th>% Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">($ in millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Research and development expenses</td>\n<td>$ 5,268</td>\n<td>$ 3,924</td>\n<td>$ 1,344</td>\n<td>34 %</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>% of net revenue</td>\n<td>19.6 %</td>\n<td>23.5 %</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sales, general and administrative expenses</td>\n<td>2,166</td>\n<td>1,940</td>\n<td>226</td>\n<td>12 %</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>% of net revenue</td>\n<td>8.0 %</td>\n<td>11.6 %</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total operating expenses</td>\n<td>$ 7,434</td>\n<td>$ 5,864</td>\n<td>$ 1,570</td>\n<td>27 %</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by 34% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based\ncompensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure costs.\n\n\n### Sales, General and Administrative\n\nSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, primarily driven by stock-based\ncompensation, compensation-related costs associated with employee growth, partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles.\n\n\n#### Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $29 million and $57 million in\nfiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.\n\nInterest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. Interest expense was $236 million\nand $184 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in expense reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June 2021.\n\nOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in\nforeign currency rates. Other, net, was an income of $107 million during fiscal year 2022 and not significant during fiscal year 2021. The increase\nwas primarily due to unrealized gains from our investments in non-affiliated entities. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.\n\n\n#### Income Taxes\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million and $77 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was\n1.9% and 1.7% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the amount of earnings\nsubject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially offset by the benefit of the foreign-\nderived intangible income deduction, and the discrete benefit of the domestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible\nincome deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal\nstatutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credit and the one-time benefits\nof the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions,\nincluding the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S.\nfederal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"37\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation, including the Domestication.\n\n\n### Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">(In millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash and cash equivalents</td>\n<td>$ 1,990</td>\n<td>$ 847</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Marketable securities</td>\n<td>19,218</td>\n<td>10,714</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities</td>\n<td>$ 21,208</td>\n<td>$ 11,561</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">Year Ended</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">(In millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net cash provided by operating activities</td>\n<td>$ 9,108</td>\n<td>$ 5,822</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities</td>\n<td>$ (9,830)</td>\n<td>$ (19,675)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net cash provided by financing activities</td>\n<td>$ 1,865</td>\n<td>$ 3,804</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.65 billion from the end of fiscal\nyear 2021. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit\nexposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, due to higher net income, partially offset by\nchanges in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by prepayments of $1.87 billion for long-term supply agreements and\nincreases in trade receivables due to higher revenue.\n\nCash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, reflecting lower payments in acquiring\nbusinesses as compared to the acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, and higher marketable securities sales and maturities, partially offset by\nhigher purchases of marketable securities.\n\nCash provided by financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2022 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2021, which primarily reflects a debt\nrepayment in the fiscal year 2022 and higher tax payments on restricted stock units.\n\n\n#### Liquidity\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of\nJanuary 30, 2022, we had $21.21 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our\noperating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and additional\nsupply. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future\ncapital requirements.\n\nOur marketable securities consist of certificates of deposits and debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated\ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer\nto Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our\noperations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.4 billion related to property and equipment.\n\nWe have approximately $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any\nrelated foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal\nincome taxes. Following the Domestication, we\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"38\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nhave utilized almost all of our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, resulting in higher cash tax payments starting in\nfiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the TCJA requires taxpayers to capitalize research and development expenditures and to\namortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. This will impact cash flows from operations and result in\nsignificantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n\n#### Capital Return to Shareholders\n\nIn fiscal year 2022, we paid $399 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under\nthat program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the\nbest interests of our shareholders.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24\nbillion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2022.\n\n\n#### Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had outstanding:\n\n\u00b7 $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2023;\n\n\u00b7 $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2024;\n\n\u00b7 $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2026;\n\n\u00b7 $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2028;\n\n\u00b7 $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030;\n\n\u00b7 $1.25 billion of Notes Due 2031;\n\n\u00b7 $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040;\n\n\u00b7 $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050; and\n\n\u00b7 $500 million of Notes Due 2060.\n\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 30, 2022, we had not issued any\ncommercial paper.\n\nRefer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ndiscussion.\n\n\n### Contractual Obligations\n\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $729 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $59 million recorded in non-current income tax\npayable as of January 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in\nindividual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are\ncurrently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n\nFor a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.\n\n\n#### Climate Change\n\nRefer to Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance activities. To date,\nthere has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from sourcing\nrenewable energy or climate-related business trends. There are no material current climate change regulations impacting us, however, we are\nmonitoring potential regulation changes in California, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions. We believe\nthat climate change has not had a material impact to our revenue to date. We have not experienced any significant physical effects of climate\nchange to date on our operations and results, nor any significant impacts on the cost or availability of insurance. In fiscal year 2023, we plan to build\nEarth-2, an Al supercomputer dedicated to predicting the impacts of climate change and increase our purchases of Renewable Energy Credits.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"39\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of\nadoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n\n\n## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n\n### Investment and Interest Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed\nconsistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of\nboth plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a zero percent yield floor, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $33 million,\nor an increase in fair value for these investments of $22 million, respectively.\n\nAt January 30, 2022, we had $11.00 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest\nrates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\n\n\n### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are\nincluded in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in\ndetermining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\n\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to\nexchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States' dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive,\nwhich could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States' dollar relative to other currencies\ncould result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur\nexpenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker\ndollar.\n\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We\ndesignate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on\nthe contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related\noperating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.\n\nWe also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the\nchange in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency\ndenominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.\n\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $103 million and $84 million lower as of\nJanuary 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be\nexpected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\n\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact\non income before taxes of approximately $41 million and $44 million as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, respectively. These changes in\nfair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary\nassets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"40\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\n\n\n## ITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n\nNone.\n\n\n## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\n\n### Controls and Procedures\n\n\n#### Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on their evaluation as of January 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange\nAct) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.\n\n\n#### Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 based on\nthe criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 30, 2022.\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\n\n\n#### Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 30, 2022 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise\nresource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately\nmaintain the Company's financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases with the consolidated financial reporting\nand general ledger module to be implemented in fiscal year 2023. We will evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that affect our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\n\n\n#### Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,\nnot absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are\nresource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control\nsystems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been\ndetected.\n\n\n## ITEM 9B.

We also have audited the Company's internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of January 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\nas of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nJanuary 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on\na test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\n##### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A\ncompany's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"45\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n##### Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\n##### Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\nto the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company's inventory provisions relate to excess\nquantities of products, based on the Company's inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future\ndemand and market conditions. As of January 30, 2022, the Company's consolidated inventories balance was $2,605 million.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for\nexcess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's assumptions related to future demand and market\nconditions.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's provisions for excess or\nobsolete inventories, including controls over management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\nincluded, among others, testing management's process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the\nappropriateness of management's approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the\nreasonableness of management's assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management's assumptions related to\nfuture demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current\nand past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv)\ncomparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nMarch 17, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"46\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak

STATEMENTS\n\n\n## Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n\n### Our Company\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\nAll references to \"NVIDIA,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\" mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, we executed a four-for-one stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related\nshareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\n\n\n### Fiscal Year\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2022 and 2020 were both 52-week years. Fiscal year\n2021 was a 53-week year.\n\n\n### Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\n\n\n### Principles of Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances\nand transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n\n### Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we\nevaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,\nincome taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other\ncontingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on\nhistorical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud\nservices. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the\nperformance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to\ndetermine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance\nobligation.\n\n\n### Product Sales Revenue\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect\nto receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware,\nand/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is\nrecognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at\nthe time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed\nhistorical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product\nreturns.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"52\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and\nmarketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are\ndesigned to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and\naccrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we\nrecognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which\nthe development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the\nestimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for\nsuch loss in that period.\n\n\n## Software Licensing\n\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase\neither perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software.\nSoftware licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and\nupgrades. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\n\n\n## Cloud Services\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a\nsubscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\ncontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs.\n\n\n### Product Warranties\n\nWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any\nmanufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the\npoint of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also\naccrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\n\n### Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted\nstock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo\nsimulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs.\nThe compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee\nservice period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares\nto be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in\nMarch and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally,\nwe estimate forfeitures at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual\nforfeitures differ from those estimates.\n\n\n### Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\n\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving\npatent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services\noffered by us and by third parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be\ncertain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"53\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nsettlement payments or judgements. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation,\ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which\ncould require us to record additional costs.\n\n\n## Foreign Currency Remeasurement\n\nWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are\nremeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and\nequity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except\nfor those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from\nforeign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.\n\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal\nyear by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects\nattributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of\nany tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the\napplication of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an\nanticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the\nrecorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense\nin our financial statements accordingly.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets that management\ndetermined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain\njurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the\ndeferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the\ntechnical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax\nexpense.\n\n\n## Net Income Per Share\n\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income\nper share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the\ntreasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net\nincome per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive.\n\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of\npurchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when\npurchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current\noperations.\n\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-\nfor-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income\nor loss, a component of shareholders' equity, net of\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"54\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ntax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are\ndetermined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of\nIncome.\n\nAll of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt\nsecurities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the\namortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized\ncost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements\nof Income.\n\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their\nrelatively short maturities as of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are\nreported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of\nshareholders' equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are\nrecognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the\nintended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are\nrecognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a\ncomponent of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in\nearnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\n\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and\naccounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and\ncredit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition\nand maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based\non overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\n\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs\nconsist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including\nlabor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products\nand other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value\nor for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future\nproduct purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or\nwritten-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase\ncommitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\n\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the\nestimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty\nyears. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded\nunder finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"55\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in\noperating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating\nlease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments\nover the lease term.\n\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental\nborrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease\nterms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\n\n### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For\nthe purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.\n\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the\nreporting units.\n\nOur quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income\nand market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates,\nresidual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions\nand estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\n\n\n## Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\n\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D,\nand customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible\nassets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the\nintangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We\ninitially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D\nas an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset's estimated useful life.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset\ngroups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash\nflows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value\nof the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or\nasset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be\nreported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\n\n\n## Business Combination\n\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired,\nincluding IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible\nand intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"56\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nto determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\n\n\n## Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities\n\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or\nobservable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using\nobservable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and\ninherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the\ninvestee.\n\nMarketable equity investments in publicly-held companies are recorded at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\n\n## Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n### Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\n\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to require that an acquirer recognize and measure\ncontract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. We early adopted this accounting standard in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the impact was immaterial.\n\n\n## Note 2 - Business Combination\n\n\n### Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\n\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired\nArm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We\nintend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided\nat signing in September 2020.\n\n\n### Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.\n\nIn April 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $7.13 billion. Mellanox is a\nsupplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data\ncenter workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"57\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n\n## Purchase Price Allocation\n\nThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Purchase Price</th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1)</td>\n<td>$ 7,033</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2)</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total cash consideration</td>\n<td>7,049</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3)</td>\n<td>85</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total purchase consideration</td>\n<td>$ 7,134</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Allocation</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash and cash equivalents</td>\n<td>$ 115</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Marketable securities</td>\n<td>699</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accounts receivable, net</td>\n<td>216</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inventories</td>\n<td>320</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Prepaid expenses and other assets</td>\n<td>179</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Property and equipment, net</td>\n<td>144</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Goodwill</td>\n<td>3,431</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intangible assets</td>\n<td>2,970</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accounts payable</td>\n<td>(136)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accrued and other current liabilities</td>\n<td>(236)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income tax liability</td>\n<td>(191)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deferred income tax liability</td>\n<td>(258)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other long-term liabilities</td>\n<td>(119)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>$ 7,134</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n(1) Represents the cash consideration of $125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares.\n\n(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.\n\n(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox's stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.\n\n\nWe allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values.\n\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings,\nbut instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not\nexpected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and\nNetworking segment. Refer to Note 17 - Segment Information for further details on segments.\n\nThe operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April\n27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income\nattributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $28 million were included in selling, general and\nadministrative expense for fiscal year 2021.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"58\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets at the time of the acquisition are as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Fair Value</th>\n<th>Useful Lives</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">(In millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Developed technology (1)</td>\n<td>$ 1,640</td>\n<td>5 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Customer relationships (2)</td>\n<td>440</td>\n<td>3 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Order backlog (3)</td>\n<td>190</td>\n<td>Based on actual shipments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade names (4)</td>\n<td>70</td>\n<td>5 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total identified finite-lived intangible assets</td>\n<td>2,340</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IPR&amp;D (5)</td>\n<td>630</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total identified intangible assets</td>\n<td>$ 2,970</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n(1)\nThe fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.\n\n(2)\nCustomer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method.\n\n(3)\nOrder backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.

Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $630 million for the fair value of this project, which was initially not\namortized. Instead, the project is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be\nimpaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once and if the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the\nintangible asset over its estimated useful life.\n\n\n### Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information\n\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA and Mellanox as if the\ncompanies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th colspan=\"3\">Pro Forma</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"3\">Year Ended</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">January 26, 2020</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">(In millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td>$ 17,104</td>\n<td>$</td>\n<td>12,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income</td>\n<td>$ 4,757</td>\n<td>$</td>\n<td>2,114</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nThe unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to stock-based\ncompensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs.

Our\nexpected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant\ndate. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs,\nand market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"61\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nAdditionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in\nsubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

In\naddition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive\nplans and converted them into our RSUs.\n\n\n## Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the 2007 Plan.\n\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock\nappreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants.\nOnly our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 30, 2022, up to 50 million shares of our common stock could be issued\npursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 6 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All\noptions are fully vested, the last of which will expire by December 2023 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs\nunder the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 30, 2022, there were 131 million shares available for future grants.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on\na pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period,\nsubject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting\nquarterly thereafter. PSUs vest over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the\nanniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary\nof the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined\nby the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.\n\n\n## Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nIn 2012, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, or the\n2012 Plan.\n\nEmployees who participate in the 2012 Plan may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may\ndecrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of\nsix months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common\nstock on the commencement date of each offering period or the fair market value of the common stock on each purchase date within the offering. As\nof January 30, 2022, we had 233 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"62\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n\n## Equity Award Activity\n\nThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\n<th colspan=\"2\">RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Number of Shares</th>\n<th>Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">(In millions, except per share data)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balances, January 31, 2021</td>\n<td>59</td>\n<td>$ 66.17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Granted</td>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>$ 190.69</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vested restricted stock</td>\n<td>(29)</td>\n<td>$ 66.67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Canceled and forfeited</td>\n<td>(2)</td>\n<td>$ 86.47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balances, January 30, 2022</td>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>$ 114.19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vested and expected to vest after January 30, 2022</td>\n<td>46</td>\n<td>$ 113.84</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, there were 131 million and 148 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for future\ngrants under our equity incentive plans.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $1.38 billion, with an average exercise price of\n$3.55 per share and an average remaining term of 1.1 years.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the\nimpact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives\nwho they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified\ncompensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may\ndeem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA's motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered\njudgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument is scheduled for May 10, 2022.\n\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs'\nappeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that\nit would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The lawsuit asserts claims,\npurportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate\nassets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading\nstatements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages\nand other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA's corporate governance and internal procedures.\n\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz\nv. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of\nthe plaintiffs' appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against\ncertain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information,\ncorporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and\nmisleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified\ndamages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\n\n\n### Accounting for Loss Contingencies\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on\nour belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these\nmatters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business\nand, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse\neffect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"72\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of

deferred tax assets of $1.22 billion and $806 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $245 million and $241 million for fiscal\nyears 2022 and 2021, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n\nWe recognized income tax expense of $189 million, $77 million, and $174 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively. Our annual\neffective tax rate was 1.9%, 1.7%, and 5.9% for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year\n2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"74\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nincrease in the amount of earnings subject to U.S. tax, and a decreased impact of tax benefits from the U.S. federal research tax credit, partially\noffset by the benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction and the discrete benefit of the Domestication. The decrease in our effective\ntax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United\nStates tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we simplified our corporate structure by repatriating the economic rights of certain non-U.S. IP to the United States via\ndomestication of a foreign subsidiary, or the Domestication. The Domestication more closely aligns our corporate structure to our operating structure\nin accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting conclusions and changes to\nU.S. and European tax laws. The impact of the Domestication, which is regarded as a change in tax status, resulted in a discrete benefit primarily\nfrom re-valuing certain deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $244 million in fiscal year 2022.\n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible\nincome deduction, income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Israel, that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal\nstatutory tax rate, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits and the one-time\nbenefits of the Domestication.\n\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in\njurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate,\nrecognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of\nnet deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in\ncertain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.05 billion and $232 million of cumulative undistributed earnings held by\ncertain subsidiaries in Israel and the United Kingdom, respectively. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for\ntemporary differences related to these investments as the determination of such amount is not practicable.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million and $728 million, respectively, related to state and\ncertain other deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\nincome. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income\ntax benefits during the period.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $397 million, $345 million and $341 million,\nrespectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $341 million\nmay be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 30, 2022, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $102 million that will begin to expire\nin fiscal year 2042. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.24 billion, of which $1.18 billion is attributable to the State of California and\nmay be carried over indefinitely, and $55 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023. Our tax attributes,\nnet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other\nauthoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit\ncarryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar\nstate and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as\napplicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had $1.01 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $808 million would affect our effective tax rate if\nrecognized. However, $181 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in\nthe form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $808 million of net unrecognized tax benefits as\nof January 30, 2022 consisted of $670 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable and $138 million reflected as a net reduction to the\ndeferred tax assets.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"75\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>January 30, 2022</th>\n<th>January 31, 2021</th>\n<th>January 26, 2020</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">(In millions)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance at beginning of period</td>\n<td>$ 776</td>\n<td>$ 583</td>\n<td>$ 477</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increases in tax positions for current year</td>\n<td>246</td>\n<td>158</td>\n<td>104</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increases in tax positions for prior years (1)</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decreases in tax positions for prior years</td>\n<td>(4)</td>\n<td>(11)</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settlements</td>\n<td>(8)</td>\n<td>(5)</td>\n<td>\u2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lapse in statute of limitations</td>\n<td>(11)</td>\n<td>(9)</td>\n<td>(5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance at end of period</td>\n<td>$ 1,013</td>\n<td>$ 776</td>\n<td>$ 583</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition.\n\n\nWe classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for\nincome taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable, if\nwe anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.\n\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 30, 2022, January 31,\n2021, and January 26, 2020, we had accrued $59 million, $44 million, and $31 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related\nto unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 30, 2022, unrecognized tax\nbenefits of $670 million and the related interest and penalties of $59 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.\n\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our\naccrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised\nestimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 30, 2022, we do not believe that our estimates, as\notherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.\n\nWe are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 30, 2022, the significant tax jurisdictions\nthat may be subject to examination include China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and the United States for fiscal\nyears 2005 through 2021. As of January 30, 2022, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include Germany,\nIndia, Israel, and the United States for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.\n\n\n## Note 15 - Shareholders' Equity\n\n\n### Capital Return Program\n\nBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.\n\nThrough January 30, 2022, we have repurchased an aggregate of 1.04 billion shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08\nbillion. As of January 30, 2022, we have a remaining authorization, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up\nto $7.24 billion through December 2022. From January 31, 2022 through March 17, 2022, we repurchased 7.7 million shares of our common stock\nfor $1.75 billion.\n\nDuring fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid $399 million, $395 million, and $390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders, respectively.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors approved the retirement of our existing 349 million treasury shares. These\nshares assumed the status of authorized and unissued shares upon retirement. The excess of repurchase price over par value was allocated\nbetween additional paid-in capital and retained earnings, resulting in a reduction in additional paid-in capital by $20 million and retained earnings by\n$12.0 billion. Any future repurchased shares will assume the status of authorized and unissued shares.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"76\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Table of Contents\" -->\n\n\n# NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n\n## Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans\n\nWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries.

This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, \"Common Stock\" and \"Preferred Stock.\" The\ntotal number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is Four Billion Two Million (4,002,000,000) shares. Four Billion (4,000,000,000)\nshares shall be Common Stock, each having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). Two Million (2,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock,\neach having a par value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001).\n\nThe Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is hereby authorized, by filing a\ncertificate (a \"Preferred Stock Designation\") pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, to fix or alter from time to time the designation,\npowers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any wholly unissued series of\nPreferred Stock, and to establish from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series or any of them; and to increase or decrease\nthe number of shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such series then\noutstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the shares constituting such\ndecrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.\n\nV.\n\nFor the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation\nof the powers of the Corporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:\n\nA. 1. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation shall be vested in its Board of Directors. The\nnumber of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted by the Board of\nDirectors.\n\n2\\. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Board of Directors is and shall remain divided into three classes, with the\ndirectors in each class serving for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders held after their election. Subject to the rights of the\nholders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the terms of the members of the Board of\nDirectors shall be as follows: (i) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or such\ndirectors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013; (ii) at the annual\nmeeting of stockholders to be held in 2013, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or such directors' successors shall be elected to hold\noffice for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014; and (iii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014\nand at\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\neach annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of\nstockholders. The classification of the Board of Directors shall terminate at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014 and all directors\nshall be elected in accordance with clause (iii) above.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article, each director shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his\ndeath, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent\ndirector.\n\n3\\. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, the Board of Directors or any individual director may be\nremoved from office at any time (i) with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding\nshares of voting stock of the Corporation, entitled to vote at an election of directors (the \"Voting Stock\") or (ii) without cause by the affirmative vote of\nthe holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Voting Stock.\n\n4\\. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from\ndeath, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of\ndirectors, shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the\nstockholders, except as otherwise provided by law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though less\nthan a quorum of the Board of Directors, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold\noffice for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such director's successor shall have\nbeen elected and qualified.\n\n5\\. In the event that Section 2115(a) of the California Corporations Code is applicable to this corporation, then the following shall\napply:\n\na. Every stockholder entitled to vote in any election of directors of this corporation may cumulate such stockholder's votes\nand give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the\nstockholder's shares are otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholder's votes on the same principle among as many candidates as such\nstockholder thinks fit;\n\nb. No stockholder, however, may cumulate such stockholder's votes for one or more candidates unless (i) the names of\nsuch candidates have been properly placed in nomination, in accordance with the Bylaws of the corporation, prior to the voting, (ii) the stockholder\nhas given advance notice to the corporation of the intention to cumulative votes pursuant to the Bylaws, and (iii) the stockholder has given proper\nnotice to the other stockholders at the meeting, prior to voting, of such stockholder's intention to cumulate such stockholder's votes; and\n\nc. If any stockholder has given proper notice, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates who have\nbeen properly placed in nomination. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the\nnumber of directors to be elected by such shares shall be declared elected.\n\nB. 1. Subject to paragraph (h) of Section 43 of the Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the\naffirmative vote of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the\nCorporation entitled to vote at an election of directors (the \"Voting Stock\"). The Board of Directors shall also have the power to adopt, amend, or\nrepeal Bylaws.\n\n2\\. The directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so provide.\n\n3\\. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in\naccordance with the Bylaws and following the closing of the Initial Public Offering no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n4\\. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before\nany meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation.\n\nVI.\n\nA. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach\nof fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or\nomissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law\nis amended after approval by the stockholders of this Article to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of\ndirectors, then the liability of a director shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as so\namended.\n\nB. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI shall be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article VI in effect at the time of\nthe alleged occurrence of any act or omission to act giving rise to liability or indemnification.\n\nVII.\n\nA. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the\nmanner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, except as provided in paragraph B of this Article VII, and all rights conferred upon the stockholders\nherein are granted subject to this reservation.\n\nB. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or any provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser\nvote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of any particular class or series of the Voting Stock required by law, this\nCertificate of Incorporation or any Preferred Stock Designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-\n2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter,\namend or repeal Articles V, VI and VII.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3\" -->\n<!-- PageHeader=\"Exhibit 4.7\" -->\n\n\n# DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT'S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (\"we,\" \"our,\" \"us,\" or the \"Company\") has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"): our common stock.\n\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK\n\n\n### General\n\nThe following summary of the terms of our common stock is based upon our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended\nand restated bylaws. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by express reference to, the\napplicable provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, of which this Exhibit 4.7 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to read our restated certificate\nof incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\") for more\ninformation.\n\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 4,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001\npar value.\n\n\n### Common Stock\n\nThe holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The\nholders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, and as a consequence, minority\nstockholders are not able to elect directors on the basis of their votes alone. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any shares of\npreferred stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be\ndeclared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our\ncommon stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding\npreferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are\nno redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\n\n\n### Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents\n\nCertificate of Incorporation\n\nStockholders have no cumulative voting rights.\n\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called\nannual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing and that the stockholders may amend our bylaws or\nadopt new bylaws only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting securities. A special meeting of the stockholders may be called\nby our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer or a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors. These provisions may\nhave the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control.\n\nThe lack of cumulative voting could make it more difficult for our existing stockholders to replace our board of directors as well as for another party to\nobtain control of us by replacing our board of directors. Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers, these\nprovisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nThese and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. These provisions are\nintended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies of our board of directors and\nto discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control. These provisions are designed to reduce our\nvulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy rights.\nHowever, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, such\nprovisions also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our shares that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions\nalso may have the effect of preventing changes in our management.\n\n\n#### Section 203 of the DGCL\n\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a \"business\ncombination\" with any \"interested stockholder\" for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an \"interested\nstockholder,\" unless:\n\n. prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the\nstockholder becoming an interested holder;\n\n. upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder\nowned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of\ndetermining the number of shares outstanding those shares owned (a) by persons who are directors and also officers and (b) by employee\nstock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be\ntendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\n\u00b7 at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special\nmeeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not\nowned by the interested stockholder.\n\nIn general, Section 203 of the DGCL defines \"business combination\" to include the following:\n\n\u00b7 any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder;\n\n\u00b7 any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the interested stockholder;\n\n\u00b7 subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the\ninterested stockholder;\n\n. any transaction involving the corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock or any class or series of the\ncorporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or\n\n\u00b7 the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits provided by or\nthrough the corporation.\n\nIn general, Section 203 of the DGCL defines \"interested stockholder\" as an entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding\nvoting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.\n\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n#### Certain Transactions\n\nOur bylaws provide that we indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law.\nWe are also empowered under our bylaws to indemnify other officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable\nlaw and to enter into indemnification contracts with our directors and executive officers and to purchase insurance on behalf of any person whom we\nare required or permitted to indemnify.\n\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent\npermissible under Delaware law. Pursuant to Delaware law, our directors shall not be liable for monetary damages for breach of the directors'\nfiduciary duty of care to us and our stockholders. However, this provision does not eliminate the duty of care, and in appropriate circumstances,\nequitable remedies such as injunctive or other forms of non-monetary relief that will remain available under Delaware law. In addition, each director\nwill continue to be subject to liability for (1) breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (2) acts or omissions not in good faith or\nwhich involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) violating Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) any transaction from which the\ndirector derived an improper personal benefit. The provision also does not affect a director's responsibilities under any other law, such as the federal\nsecurities laws or state or federal environmental laws.\n\n\n### Transfer Agent and Registrar\n\nComputershare is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.

The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common\nStock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this\nAgreement and in the Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by\nthe Company for your benefit (the \"Account\") the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as\notherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to\nyour receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.\n\n2\\. Vesting. Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance\nwith the vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable,\ncontained in the Grant Notice. Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if termination\nis by reason of death, in which case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other\nacceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan). On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason\nother than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to the Account that were not vested on the date of such\ntermination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be\nforfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further right, title or interest in or\nto such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuous\nService during only a period prior to a vesting date (but where Continuous Service has terminated prior to the vesting\ndate) does not entitle you to vest in a pro-rata portion of the Restricted Stock Units on such date.\n\n\n## 3. Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.\n\n(a) The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your\nAward will be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.\n\n(b) Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a\nresult of a Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on\ntransferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered by your Award.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"1.\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n(c) No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3.\nThe Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for\nfractional shares.\n\n4\\. Compliance with Law. You will not be issued any shares under your Award unless either (a) the shares are\nregistered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the\nregistration requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations\ngoverning the Award, including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares\nif the Company determines that such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.\n\n5\\. Limitations on Transfer. Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and\ndistribution. In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to\nassign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock\nsubject to the Award until the shares are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign,\nhypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are\nin compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board\nand valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to the Company, in a form satisfactory to the\nCompany, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be entitled to receive any distribution of\nCommon Stock to which you were entitled at the time of your death pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n\n## 6. Date of Issuance.\n\n(a) The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to\ncomply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to\nthe extent applicable.\n\n(b) Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section\n10 of this Agreement), in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the\napplicable vesting date, one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests and such issuance date is\nreferred to as the \"Original Issuance Date.\" If the Original Issuance Date falls on a date that is not a business day,\ndelivery will instead occur on the next following business day.\n\n(c) However, if (i) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an \"open window period\"\napplicable to you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company's then-effective policy on trading in\nCompany securities, or (2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an\nestablished stock exchange or stock market (including but not limited to under a previously established Company-\napproved 10b5-1 trading plan), and (ii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any\nwithholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock\nfrom the shares otherwise due, on the Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter\ninto a \"same day sale\" commitment with a broker-dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a\ncommitment under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover\nany withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"2.\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nSection 10 below) in cash, then the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not\nbe delivered on such Original Issuance Date and will instead be delivered on the first business day when you are not\nprohibited from selling shares of the Company's Common Stock in the open public market, but in no event later than\nDecember 31 of the calendar year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year\nin which the Original Issuance Date occurs), or, if and only if permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury\nRegulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), no later than the date that is the 15th day of the third calendar month of the year\nfollowing the year in which the shares of Common Stock under this Award are no longer subject to a \"substantial risk of\nforfeiture\" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(d). The form of such delivery of the shares\n(e.g., a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company.\n\n7\\. Dividends. You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with\nrespect to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment.\nFollowing the date of vesting, in the event of any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result\nfrom a Capitalization Adjustment, no cash, stock or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable\nin respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.\n\n8\\.

Nothing in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the\nschedule set forth in the Grant Notice or the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of\ngood faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in this Agreement or the Plan will: (i) confer upon you any right to\ncontinue in the employ of, or continue an affiliation or other service relationship with the Service Recipient; (ii) constitute\nany promise or commitment by the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate regarding the fact or nature of\nfuture positions, future work assignments, future compensation or any other term or condition of employment or\naffiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically\naccrued under the terms of this Agreement or Plan; or (iv) deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate you at\nany time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity that you may have. The grant of the Award shall not be\ninterpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with the Company or the Service Recipient.\n\n(b) By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is\nearned only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other\naward or benefit) and that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of\nits businesses or Affiliates at any time or from time to time, as it deems appropriate (a \"reorganization\"). You further\nacknowledge and agree that such a reorganization could result in the termination of your Continuous Service, or the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"3.\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\ntermination of Affiliate status of the Service Recipient and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to, the termination of the right to continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and\nagree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this\nAgreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit in any of them do not constitute an\nexpress or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee or Consultant for the term of this Agreement, for\nany period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Service Recipient to terminate your\nContinuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice, and\nwill not interfere in any way with the Company's right to conduct a reorganization.\n\n\n## 10.

You further acknowledge that\nthe Company and/or the Service Recipient (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any\nTax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common\nStock, including, but not limited to, the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted\nStock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not\ncommit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or\neliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. You acknowledge and agree that you\nwill not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or Affiliates (including the\nService Recipient) for Tax-Related Items arising from your Award. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in\nmore than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may be required to\nwithhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\n\n(b) In connection with the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make\nadequate arrangements satisfactorily to the Company, and/or the Service Recipient to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In\nthis regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to\nsatisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the\nfollowing: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii) causing you to\ntender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting\nor requiring you to enter into a \"same day sale\" commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority (a \"FINRA Dealer\") (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent)\nwhereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock\nUnits to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds\nnecessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or the Service\nRecipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv)\nwithholding shares of Common Stock from the shares of\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"4.\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\nCommon Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the amount of\nsuch withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding\nclassification of the Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however that if you are an Officer,\nthen the Company will withhold a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding\nevent, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially\nadverse accounting consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which case, any withholding\nobligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other\nmethod of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the\nPlan.\n\n(c) The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by\nconsidering statutory or other withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event\nof over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash from the Company or the Service\nRecipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may seek a refund from the local\ntax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the\napplicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable\nrates in your country, including your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax\nauthority's administrative practices, not to exceed the highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the\nhighest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding\na number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the full number of\nshares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of\nCommon Stock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.\n\n(d) Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no\nobligation to deliver to you any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.\n\n(e) In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock\nor it is determined after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to you that the amount of the withholding obligation was\ngreater than the amount withheld, if anything, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company and/or the Service\nRecipient harmless from any failure by the Company and/or the Service Recipient to withhold the proper amount.\n\n11\\.

Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator\nand Dynamics to transform business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning\ngives human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build\ncustom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise.\n\nThese scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and management. Organizations of\nall sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications. This creates an\nopportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers.\n\n\n##### Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nIn the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees, optimize their operations,\nengage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services. Partnering with organizations on their digital\ntransformation during this period is one of our largest opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital\ntransformation platform and partner of choice; their success is our success.\n\nOur strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services. Azure is a trusted\ncloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per\nunit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving\nthe utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering\nopenness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid\nconsistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for\ncompute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to\ngateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into\ntheir own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency\nspans security, compliance, identity, and management, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of\ncommercial customers and enterprises. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-\npremises management platform. Security, compliance, identity, and management underlie our entire tech stack. We offer integrated, end-to-\nend capabilities to protect people and organizations. In April 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance\nCommunications, Inc., a cloud and Al software provider with healthcare and enterprise Al experience. The acquisition will build on our\nindustry-specific cloud offerings.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"4\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\nWe are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh enables presence and\nshared experiences from anywhere through mixed reality applications. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when\ncombined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads and experiences which we believe will\nshape the next era of computing.\n\nThe ability to convert data into Al drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server\nfrom their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. Azure Synapse Analytics, a limitless analytics\nservice, brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics for immediate business intelligence and\nmachine learning needs. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer be\nan AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the\npowerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we\nprovide a developer tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other\ncloud or client platform.\n\n\n##### Create More Personal Computing\n\nWe strive to make computing more personal by putting people at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in\nmore intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they\nadapt to more fluid ways of working and learning. The PC has been mission-critical across work, school, and life to sustain productivity in a\nremote everything world.\n\nWindows 10 serves the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with Al-first interfaces ranging\nfrom voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and mixed reality experiences. Our ambition for\nWindows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising. In June 2021, Microsoft announced\nthe next generation of Windows - Windows 11. Windows 11 builds on the strengths of productivity, versatility, and security on Windows 10\ntoday and adds in new experiences that include powerful task switching tools like new snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops; new ways to\nstay connected through chat; the information you want at your fingertips; and more. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud\nbusiness and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the \"intelligent edge.\"\n\nMicrosoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect your data, with built-in shopping tools designed to save you time and money.\nOrganizational tools such as Collections, Vertical Tabs, and Immersive Reader help you make the most of your time while browsing,\nstreaming, searching, sharing, and more.\n\nWe are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate\ndemand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Book 3, Surface Laptop Go, Surface Go 2, Surface Pro 7, Surface\nLaptop 4, Surface Pro X, Surface Studio 2, and Surface Duo.\n\nTo expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we pursue the expansive\nopportunity in the gaming industry. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are\ncreated and distributed to how they are played, including cloud gaming so players can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a\nstrong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the March 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc.,\nthe parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC, one of the largest, privately held game developers and publishers in the world. Xbox Game\nPass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft's\ngame streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want,\nwith the people they want, on the devices they want.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"5\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1\" -->\n\n\n###### Our Future Opportunity\n\nIn a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations as software and cloud\ncomputing play a huge role across every industry and around the world. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our\ncustomers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal\nis to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are\ninvesting significant resources in:\n\n\u00b7 Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate,\ncollaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.\n\n\u00b7 Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and\nindividuals.\n\n\u00b7 Applying Al to drive insights and act on our customer's behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural\nmethods of communication.\n\n. Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services\nlike Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more.\n\n\u00b7 Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and\nmanagement, across all clouds and platforms.\n\n\u00b7 Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing\nthe boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment.\n\nOur future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the\nopportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.\n\n\n#### COVID-19\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to\nhave widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices, and continues to impact\nour business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on\nour fiscal year 2021 financial results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on\nnumerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these\nfactors and other risks.\n\n\n##### Corporate Social Responsibility\n\n\n###### Commitment to Sustainability\n\nWe work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable\nfuture by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for\npolicies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030,\nand to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to\ninvest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be\nwater positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and\ncustomers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.\n\nIn January 2021, we announced that in fiscal year 2020 we reduced Microsoft's carbon emissions by 586,683 metric tons. We purchased the\nremoval of 1.3 million metric tons of carbon from 26 projects around the world. Furthermore, we shared a commitment to transparency by\nsubjecting the data in our annual sustainability report to third-party review and to accountability by including progress on sustainability goals\nas a factor in determining executive pay.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"6\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\nThe investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to\nXbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and Al services and datacenters help businesses cut energy consumption,\nreduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. We also pledged a $50 million investment in AI for Earth to accelerate innovation\nby putting Al in the hands of those working to directly address sustainability challenges. We are committed to playing our part to help\naccelerate the world's transition to a more economically and environmentally sustainable future for us all.\n\n\n###### Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\n\nOur future opportunity depends on reaching and empowering all communities, and we are committed to taking action to help address racial\ninjustice and inequity. With significant input from employees and leaders who are members of the Black and African American community, our\nsenior leadership team and board of directors announced in June 2020 that we had developed a set of actions to help improve the lived\nexperience at Microsoft and drive change in the communities in which we live and work. These efforts include increasing our representation\nand strengthening our culture of inclusion by doubling the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual\ncontributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025; evolving our ecosystem with our supply chain, banking partners, and partner\necosystem; and strengthening our communities by using data, technology, and partnerships to help address racial injustice and inequities of\nthe Black and African American communities in the U.S. and improve the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their communities.\n\nOver the last year, we have collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of\nprojects and programs including: expanding our existing justice reform work with a five-year, $50 million sustained effort, expanding access to\naffordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities and key institutions that support them in major urban centers,\nexpanding access to skills and education to support Black and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and\nincreasing technology support for nonprofits that provide critical services to Black and African American communities.\n\nWe have more than doubled our percentage share of transaction volume with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions and\nincreased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, enabling increased funds into local\ncommunities. Additionally, we have seen growth in our Black- and African American-owned supplier base and in Black- and African American-\nowned technology partners in the Microsoft Partner Network, and we launched the Black Channel Partner Alliance community to support\npartners onboarding to the Microsoft Cloud and to unlock partner benefits for co-selling with Microsoft.\n\nWe acknowledge we have more work ahead of us to address racial injustice and inequity, and are applying many of the programs above to\nhelp other underrepresented communities.\n\n\n###### Investing in Digital Skills\n\nWith a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is helping to ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies recover\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic. We announced in June 2020 that we are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly\nvital to many of the world's jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses. Our skills initiative brings together learning\nresources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn\nfrom LinkedIn's Economic Graph. We also invested $20 million in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people\nfrom underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy.\n\nOver 42 million people across every continent have accessed free training through our skills initiative. The effort surpassed its initial goals and\nhas been expanded with a new emphasis on connecting learners with jobs that help put their new training to use and connecting employers\nwith skilled job seekers they might not find in traditional networks.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"7\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n# HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\n## Overview\n\nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain diverse, world-changing talent. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an\nenvironment where people can do their best work - a place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and\nwhere they know their needs can be met. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful,\nrewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to\nempower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, we employed approximately 181,000 people on a full-time basis, 103,000 in the U.S. and 78,000 internationally. Of the\ntotal employed people, 67,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 60,000\nwere in product research and development; 40,000 were in sales and marketing; and 14,000 were in general and administration. Certain of\nour employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\n\n\n## Our Culture\n\nMicrosoft's culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. We believe\npotential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious - trying new things without fear of failure.\nWe identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish:\n\n\u00b7 Obsessing over what matters to our customers.\n\n\u00b7 Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do.\n\n\u00b7 Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses.\n\n\u00b7 Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us.\n\nOur employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs\nglobally. 88% of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2021 MS Poll engagement survey, which covers a variety of topics such as\ninclusion, pay and benefits, and learning and development. Throughout the fiscal year, we also collect nearly 75,000 Daily Pulse employee\nsurvey responses. During fiscal year 2021, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees\nthrough the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing racial injustice. In addition to poll and pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding\nand exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support.\n\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nAt Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We\nthink of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There\nare billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access\nto opportunity and achievement. The better we represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we\nseek to empower.\n\nWe strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace and workforce,\nand creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance to be their authentic selves and do\ntheir best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities,\nmilitary, people with disabilities, or who identify as LGBTQI+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As\ndescribed in our 2020 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation\nof their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of\nworkforce metrics including:\n\n\u00b7 Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types,\nlevels, and segments of our business.\n\n\u00b7 Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).\n\n\u00b7 Disability representation.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"8\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n## Total Rewards\n\nWe develop dynamic, sustainable, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and\nretain top talent and enable our employees to do their best work. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and\ngrowth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute\nto the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions.\n\nAs part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, we expanded stock eligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of our\nannual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support\nprofessionals and datacenter and retail employees.\n\n\n## Pay Equity\n\nIn our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.006 for\nevery $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.001 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts in the\nU.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our ten other largest employee geographies (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany,\nIndia, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and United Kingdom) combined earn $1.000 for every $1.000 by men in these countries. Our intended result is a\nglobal performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role\nwhile supporting pay for performance.\n\n\n## Wellness and Safety\n\nMicrosoft is committed to supporting our employees' well-being and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives.\n\nWe took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19\npandemic. We made substantial modifications to employee travel policies and implemented office closures so non-essential employees could\nwork remotely. We continued to pay hourly service providers such as cleaning and reception staff who may have otherwise been furloughed.\nWe implemented a global Paid Pandemic School and Childcare Closure Leave to support working parents, added wellbeing days for those\nwho needed to take time off for mental health and wellness, implemented on-demand COVID-19 testing and vaccinations on our Redmond,\nWashington campus, and extended full medical plan coverage for coronavirus testing, treatment, and telehealth services. We also expanded\nexisting programs such as our Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program and family backup care.\n\nIn addition to the extraordinary steps and programs relating to COVID-19, our comprehensive benefits package includes many physical,\nemotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, flexible fitness\nbenefits, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and\nSafety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working.\n\n\n## Learning and Development\n\nOur growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing - seeking out new ideas, driving innovation, embracing challenges,\nlearning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we offer a wide range of learning and development opportunities. We\nbelieve learning can be more than formal instruction, and our learning philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in\nthe right way. Opportunities include:\n\n\u00b7 Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on our internal learning portal, our external learning\nportal MS Learn, and LinkedIn Learning that is available to all employees worldwide.\n\n\u00b7 In-the-classroom learning, learning \"pods,\" our early-in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence communities.\n\n\u00b7 On-the-job \"stretch\" and advancement opportunities.\n\n\u00b7 Managers holding conversations about employees' career and development plans, coaching on career opportunities, and\nprograms like mentoring and sponsorship.\n\n\u00b7 Customized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build leadership skills for all\nemployees including differentiated leadership development programs.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"9\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\u00b7 New employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, culture, and Standards of Business Conduct, as\nwell as ongoing onboarding program.\n\nOur employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands of informal and on-\nthe-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on-line learning solutions, in fiscal year 2021 our employees completed over 5 million\ncourses, averaging over 18 hours per employee. Given our focus on understanding core company beliefs and compliance topics, all\nemployees complete required learning programs like Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy, Unconscious Bias, and preventing harassment\ncourses. Our corporate learning portal has over 100,000 average monthly active users. All of our approximately 23,000 people managers\nmust complete between 25-30 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each\nyear. In addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year.\n\n\n## New Ways of Working\n\nThe global pandemic has accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. Microsoft has introduced a Hybrid Workplace\nFlexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift paradigms, embrace flexibility,\npromote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value the flexibility related to work location, work site,\nand work hours, and while many indicate they intend to return to a worksite once conditions permit, they also intend to adjust hours or spend\nsome portions of workweeks working remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals,\nteams, and our business can be successful.\n\n\n# OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud,\nand More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The\nsegments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they\nprovide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses.\n\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and\nGeographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\n\n## Productivity and Business Processes\n\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and\ninformation services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms.

GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.\nServer products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment\nmanufacturers (\"OEM\"), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and\nWindows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product.\n\n\n## Enterprise Services\n\nEnterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and\nmanaging Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various\nMicrosoft products.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"12\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n### Competition\n\nAzure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise\nMobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and\nnumerous other security point solution vendors. Azure's competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of\nexisting datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of\nbusinesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud's global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security\nsolutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.\n\nOur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of\nmarket approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the\nUnix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating\nsystem and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large\nnumber of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies,\nsuch as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.\n\nWe compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer\nsolutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database,\nand e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our\nenterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments\ninclude CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache,\nLinux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.\n\nOur database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other\ncompanies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC,\nCA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM,\nOracle, and other companies, and also against open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and\nSAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.\n\nWe believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering\nsuperior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.\n\nOur Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application\ndevelopment, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific\ntechnologies.\n\n\n## More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our\ntechnology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (\"Windows OEM\") and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating\nsystem; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and\nother Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows IoT; and MSN advertising.\n\n\u00b7 Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.\n\n\u00b7 Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising digital transactions, Xbox Game Pass and other\nsubscriptions, video games, third-party video game royalties, cloud services, and advertising.\n\n\u00b7 Search advertising.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"13\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n## Windows\n\nThe Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of\nexperience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows\noperating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market\nvolume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:\n\n\u00b7 The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.\n\n\u00b7 Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.\n\n\u00b7 Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.\n\n\u00b7 Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.\n\n\u00b7 Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.\n\n\u00b7 Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and\nregional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.\n\n\u00b7 Constraints in the supply chain of device components.\n\n\u00b7 Piracy.\n\nWindows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as\nMicrosoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and\nSoftware Assurance (\"SA\"), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information\nworkers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.\n\nPatent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices\nand cloud offerings.\n\nWindows loT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and\nservices for use in embedded devices.\n\nMSN advertising includes both native and display ads.\n\n\n## Devices\n\nWe design and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect\nto the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help\norganizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new\ncustomers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories.\n\n\n## Gaming\n\nOur gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud. Our\nexclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming\nexperiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These\nunique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated\nlibrary of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\n\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage both on- and off-\nconsole with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued investment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud\nGaming utilizes Microsoft's Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices,\nenabling gamers to take their favorites games with them and play on the device most convenient to them.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"14\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1\" -->\n\nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and\nother devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our\ndeveloper and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales\nof first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through\nXbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of\nthe devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.\n\n\n## Search Advertising\n\nOur Search business, including Bing and Microsoft Advertising, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We\nhave several partnerships with other companies, including Verizon Media Group, through which we provide and monetize search queries.\nGrowth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings.\n\n\n## Competition\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We\nbelieve Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a\nbroad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial\ndesign and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners\nand customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\n\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those\noperated by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video\nstreaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established\nbase of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products\nand services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment\nservices, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\n\nOur search business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content\nand online offerings to end users.\n\n\n# OPERATIONS\n\nWe have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections,\ninformation processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and\nAfrican region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North\nDakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In\naddition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle\nEast and Africa.\n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize\nmany of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog\nboxes, and translating text.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use\nother manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain\ncertain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other\nmanufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could\nlead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"15\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n# RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n## Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.\n\n\u00b7 Cloud and Al, focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient through\ndevelopment of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, Al cognitive services,\nand other business process applications and services for enterprises.\n\n\u00b7 Experiences and Devices, focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including\nOffice, Windows, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Surface.\n\n\u00b7 Al and Research, focuses on our Al innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning\ninfrastructure, services, applications, and search.\n\n\u00b7 Linkedin, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.\n\n\u00b7 Gaming, focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base\nthrough game experiences and social interaction.\n\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over\nour products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they\nshould be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may\naffect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms,\nwe provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create\nproduct documentation internally.\n\nWe protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the\nenforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business\nplans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 65,000 U.S.\nand international patents issued and over 21,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property\nexclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into\nlicensees' products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire\ngroups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select\nintellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing\ninteroperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our\nincreasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.\n\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business\nmethods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other\nagreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.\n\n\n## Investing in the Future\n\nOur success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace\ndisruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We\ninvest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our\ncustomers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to\nresearch and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud\ncomputing, AI, devices, and operating systems.\n\nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and\ndevelopment facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and\nenables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"16\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world's\nlargest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-\nart in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our\ninnovation.\n\nWe generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities\nfurther in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research\nand development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the Company. We plan to continue to make significant\ninvestments in a broad range of research and development efforts.\n\n\n# DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING\n\nWe market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales\nforce performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to\nidentify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators,\nindependent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment\nfunctions for our products and services.\n\n\n## OEMs\n\nWe distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest\ncomponent of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other\nMicrosoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365.\n\nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a\ndirect agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the\nmultinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs\nare system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution\nprimarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.\n\n\n## Direct\n\nMany organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services\ncontracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations\non licensing our products and services (\"Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors\" or \"ESA\"). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted\nto reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner\nadvisors support many of these sales.\n\nWe also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our\ndigital marketplaces and online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store physical locations and opened our Microsoft\nExperience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across\nindustries.\n\n\n## Distributors and Resellers\n\nOrganizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (\"LSP\"), distributors, value-added\nresellers (\"VAR\"), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with\nlarge organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically\nauthorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner\nprogram for reselling cloud services.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"17\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\nWe distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and\nretail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party\nretailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and\nprovide product training and sales support.\n\nOur Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions\nand specialized services.\n\n\n# LICENSING OPTIONS\n\nWe offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to\norganizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of\nhaving to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of\nvarious sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below.\n\nSA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools,\ntraining, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing\nagreements and is an optional purchase with others.\n\n\n## Volume Licensing Programs\n\n\n### Enterprise Agreement\n\nEnterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services\nand software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license\ncloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses\nor subscribe to licenses. SA is included.\n\n\n### Microsoft Product and Services Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Product and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-\npremises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase\nperpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses.\n\n\n### Open\n\nOpen agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open agreements are designed for small and\nmedium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open\nagreements, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to\npurchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"18\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1\" -->\n\n\n### Select Plus\n\nSelect Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or\ndepartment level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional.\n\n\n### Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement\n\nMicrosoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision,\nand maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions\nfor cloud-based services.\n\n\n### Partner Programs\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the\nvalue-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can\neasily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.\n\nThe Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license\neligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software\nover a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption.\n\nThe Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license\nthe unified business solution to their end users.\n\n\n# CUSTOMERS\n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet\nservice providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from\ncustomers; consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"19\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1\" -->\n\n\n# INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nOur executive officers as of July 29, 2021 were as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Age</th>\n<th>Position with the Company</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Satya Nadella</td>\n<td>53</td>\n<td>Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Judson Althoff</td>\n<td>48</td>\n<td>Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Christopher C.

RISK FACTORS\n\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\n\n\n## STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\n\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating\nmargins.\n\n\n### Competition in the technology sector\n\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized\nfirms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to\nentry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our\nsuccess in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.\n\n\n### Competition among platform-based ecosystems\n\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse\nsolutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider\nthat can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face\nsignificant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.\n\n\u00b7 A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and\nrelated services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles,\nwearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the\nhardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also\nbe able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated\nhardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we\nincrease our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n\n. We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from\ncompeting platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices\ncompete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning\nto these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these\ndevices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract\napplication developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may\ndecrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their\ncompetitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer\n(\"OEM\") partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.\n\n\u00b7 Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility\nof content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move\ndata and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to\nwrite applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value.\nEfforts to compete with competitors' content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our\noperating margins. Competitors' rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute\nproducts and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"22\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\n\n### Business model competition\n\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n\n\u00b7 Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-\nbased proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting\noriginal ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue\nreceived from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers\nunder this model.\n\n. Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party\nadvertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little\ncost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n\n. Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and\nearning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and\ndevelopment for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such\nas for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves\ncloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-\nclass platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (\"Al\"). At the same\ntime, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery\nmodels are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user's choice of which\ncloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows\necosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability\nand eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of\nThings (\"loT\"). Our success in the loT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure loT Edge, and\nAzure Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives.\n\nBesides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These\ncosts will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our\nexecution in several areas, including:\n\n. Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n\n\u00b7 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices,\nincluding PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.\n\n. Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n\n\u00b7 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as\nwell as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n\n\u00b7 Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including\nthose of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing\norganizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new\nproducts and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may\nnegatively impact gross margins and operating income.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"23\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\n\n# RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\n\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant\ninvestments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating\nsystem, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We\nalso invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCS,\ntablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors,\nincluding innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as\nproviding significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades,\nunfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for\nseveral years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new\nproducts and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features,\nlike Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will\ncontinue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or\nproduct experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.\n\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or\nsignificant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.\n\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making\nacquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in October 2018\nwe completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. (\"GitHub\") for $7.5 billion, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for\n$8.1 billion, and in April 2021 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. for $19.7 billion. These\nacquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our\nbusiness strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees,\nbusiness systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be\ncompleted. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination\nor renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them\nto enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits\nfrom these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller\nthan we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to\nearnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which\ncould cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a\nchange in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a\ndecline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in\nwhich we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated\nfinancial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively\naffecting our results of operations.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"24\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1A\" -->\n\n\n# CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\n\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation\nor competitive position.\n\n\n## Security of our information technology\n\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored\norganizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide\nvariety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or\nother infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering\ntechniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions\nto gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other\ncoordinated attacks. Nation state and state sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Inadequate\naccount security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely\nremove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users'\nsecurity or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software\nupdates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\n\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and\nsuccessfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in\nthe environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal\nnetworks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security\nof our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in\nproduct development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result\nin theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the\nimpacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\nThe cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as \"Solorigate\" or \"Nobelium\" are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was\nintroduced to a software provider's customers, including us, through software updates. The attackers were later able to create false\ncredentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers' systems. We may be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as\nboth a supplier and consumer of IT.\n\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new\nways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other\nconsumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats\nemerge.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"25\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\n\n## Security of our products, services, devices, and customers' data\n\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers' decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud\nand on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology\nproducts and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based\nservices rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of\nour services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and\nservices, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises or cloud\nenvironments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\"zero day\") vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with\nseveral of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security\npatches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install\nadditional malware to further compromise customers' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as\ncustomers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our\nusers' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in\nunauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer's use of our products or\nservices. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that\nmay make our products susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired\nover many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer\nincorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a\nproduct, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security\nadvances and standards can increase our customers' vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical\nsophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of\nthe art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining\ndefault settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects\nof IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.\n\nThe Solorigate/Nobelium or similar cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly\ncompromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available\ninformation and actions for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection,\ntracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information\non how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have\nno or limited visibility into our customers' computing environments.\n\n\n## Development and deployment of defensive measures\n\nTo defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers' systems, we must continuously\nengineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to\naddress security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure\ncustomers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of\nour network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information\nabout the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health\ncare, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"26\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1A\" -->\n\nThe cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well,\nactual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our\nreputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or\nservices. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of\nadditional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to\nrun software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt\nadequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to\nclaims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance\nthese provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability\nexposure to customers.\n\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there\nis a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability\nclaims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number and scale\nof our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and\nusers. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to\ninformation security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our\nsecurity controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not\nprevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have\nlimited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our\nreputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased\ncosts or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-\npremises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or\nuser data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and\nappropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that\nthe collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could\nlimit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to\naddress customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to\ncustomer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and\nservices.\n\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and\nservices contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made\ncommitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may\nweaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using\nit for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.\n\n\n## Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.\n\n\n### Advertising, professional, and social platform abuses\n\nFor platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, MSN, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or\ninappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread\nterrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of\nour users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or\nresponding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be\nsuccessful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"27\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1A\" -->\n\n\n### Digital safety and service misuse\n\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in\nviolation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing\ntechnologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement.\nRegulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum\nand we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail\nto comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the\nintelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the loT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices\nemploying sensors, data, and computing capabilities including Al. The loT's great potential also carries substantial risks. loT products and\nservices may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An loT\nsolution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each\nlayer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many loT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be\nupdated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of loT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory\nrequirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as\nintended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if\nrealized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.\n\nIssues in the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings and we\nexpect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which Al operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our\ncustomers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that\ncould affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information.\nInappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could\nundermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or\nreputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact\non human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\n\n\n# OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations\ninfrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing\npower. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network\ninfrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new\nproducts and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft\nTeams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a\nplatform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this\ninfrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks.\nIt requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within\ncompetitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of\ncustomer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products,\nservices, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our\nreputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we\ndesign and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant\nexpenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or\naddress such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"28\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may\ncontain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business\nfunctions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances\npotentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced\nsales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability.\nAlthough our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these\nprovisions will withstand legal challenge.\n\nWe acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand\nfor hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes\nunavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or\nother reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component\nshortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox\nconsoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to\ndisruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to\nany other hardware and software products we may offer.\n\n\n# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\n\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a\nleading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments\nare actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union\n(\"EU\"), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal\nand state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\n\nThe European Commission (\"the Commission\") closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we\nmake certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies.\nFlagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission\nordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our\ncompetitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009,\nthe Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission's concerns relating to competition in web browsing\nsoftware, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in\n2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of\nthe Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may\nenable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products.\n\nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As\na result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with\ncompetition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in\nAsia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\n\nGovernment regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our\nsoftware to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition\nlaw actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them,\ncould adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including:\n\n. We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing\nalternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and\nremoving functionality that customers want or on which developers rely.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"29\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PARTI Item 1A\n\n\u00b7 We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value\nor do not protect our associated intellectual property.\n\n. We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other\nvoluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to\nsubstantial fines or other remedial actions.\n\n\u00b7 Our ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited.\n\nOur global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\"Anti-Corruption Laws\") prohibit corrupt payments by\nour employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and\nadequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports\nfrom employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we\nreceive such reports directly and investigate them. On July 22, 2019, our Hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement\n(\"NPA\") with the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. These agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to\nactivities at Microsoft's subsidiary in Hungary. The NPA, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements,\nincluding the obligations to disclose to the DOJ issues that may implicate the FCPA and to cooperate in any inquiries. Most countries in which\nwe operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between\nthemselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies,\ntraining, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may\nviolate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal\nsanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\n\nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to\ntrade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries\nsuch as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to,\nor making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and\ncommunication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications\ntechnology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Non-compliance could result in reputational harm, operational delays,\nmonetary fines, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.\n\nOther regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy,\ntelecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that\nour offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws,\nincluding EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more of our services as regulated\ntelecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security,\nand law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer and other data is\ninconsistent with their laws and regulations. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to\ndevelop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content\nmoderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to\nchange over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments' approach to their\nenforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs\nor require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties\nor orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity.\n\nWe strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal.\nThere is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more\naccessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face\nregulatory or legal actions.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"30\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1A\" -->\n\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased\ncosts, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies\nincreasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and\ntransfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy\nShield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal\nrequirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms. Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across\nborders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. In May 2018, the EU General Data\nProtection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), became effective. The law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or\n\nEngineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion\nof engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are\nunable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data\nregulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. The GDPR imposes significant new\nobligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply\nwith the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can\nresult in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, reputational damage, and loss of customers. Countries\naround the world, and states in the U.S. such as California, Colorado, and Virginia, have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding,\nlaws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data.\n\nThe Company's investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our\noperational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data\nin this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal\nanalyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or\ninconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of\nour customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding\npersonal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced\nefficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or\noffer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in\nsignificant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and\neffort.\n\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These\nclaims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, significant\nbusiness transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in\nsignificant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims\nare subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our\nconsolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably\nestimable.\n\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government\ncontracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we\nmay be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental\ncontractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements\nmay allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to\nperiodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events\ncould negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"31\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1A\" -->\n\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\nrequired in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations\nwhere the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") and\npossible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates\nin our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance\nevolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our\nresults may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax\nestimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to\nincrease tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal\nRevenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits,\nand other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our\nconsolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\n\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country\nmay result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to\ncorporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in\ntaxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\n\n# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\n\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed\nprogram commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our\napplication and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of\nour source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third\nparties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized\ndisclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\n\nLegal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property.\nProtecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a\nglobal basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant,\nparticularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may\ngrow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure\nconsistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining\nindemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where\nintellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect\nrevenue.\n\nWe expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by\nincorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others\nin return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of\npatented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more\ndifficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail\nto satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize\nour intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value\nfrom cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also\ncause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"32\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property\nrights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive\npatent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface. To\nresolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop\nselling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These\noutcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that\nmay limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as\nGermany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant\namounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of\nour strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.\n\n\n# GENERAL RISKS\n\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are\nglobally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business,\nand public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality\nissues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from\ncustomers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or\npublic policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\n\n\u00b7 The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.\n\n\u00b7 Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.\n\n\u00b7 Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.\n\nThe proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are\ndamaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.\n\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession,\npandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs,\nservers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely\naffected.\n\nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been\na significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or\nretailer, could cause sales channel disruption.\n\nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a\nresult, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,\nmarket, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant\npart of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a\ndowngrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be\nadversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment\ncharges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"33\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1A\" -->\n\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of\na major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing\nsales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business\noperations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the\ndestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could\nharm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a\npremium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of\nprolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nAbrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may\nincrease our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our\ncustomers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory\nsystems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global\nmarkets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with\nsome public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\n\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial\nmarkets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus, including social\ndistancing, travel restrictions, and vaccination programs. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions\nhave relaxed, new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact\nour business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature\nand degree of its continued effects over time.\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot\nreliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the\npandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may\nadversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and\nservices on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management's accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in\ngreater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-\nlooking guidance.\n\nMeasures to contain the virus that impact us, our partners, distributors, and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks\ndescribed in these Risk Factors. Any of these may adversely impact our ability to:\n\n\u00b7 Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services.\n\n\u00b7 Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through\ndatacenter load balancing.\n\n\u00b7 Ensure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter\noperations.\n\n\u00b7 Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies.\n\n\u00b7 Hire and deploy people where we most need them.\n\n\u00b7 Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution\nfunctions.\n\nWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our\nrevenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"34\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART ! Item 1A\" -->\n\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or\nchanges in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services,\nincluding natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and\ncooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.\n\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part\nof our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our\nresults of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as\npolitical and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents\nseveral risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and\nmanaging foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific\ncountries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism,\nprotectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls,\ninvestment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in\ndeveloped or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a\nportion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies\nmay adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and\nretaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders\nin our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that\nenables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit\ninternationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and\nprofessional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may\nbe adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of\nknowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws\nare interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our\nworkforce needs.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"35\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PARTI Item 1B, 2, 3, 4\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\n\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nthat were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2021 that remain unresolved.\n\n\n# ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King\nCounty, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These\nfacilities include approximately 10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 520 acres of land we own at our corporate\nheadquarters, and approximately 5 million square feet of space we lease.

We\nstrive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business\nproductivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health\noutcomes, and empower human ingenuity.\n\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an\narray of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our\nmost significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and\nservices; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes.\n\nAs the world continues to respond to COVID-19, we are working to do our part by ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the\nhealth and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their\nbest work while remote.\n\nHighlights from fiscal year 2021 compared with fiscal year 2020 included:\n\n\u00b7 Commercial cloud revenue increased 34% to $69.1 billion.\n\n\u00b7 Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 22%.\n\n\u00b7 Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 10% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to\n51.9 million.\n\n\u00b7 Linkedin revenue increased 27%.\n\n\u00b7 Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 43%.\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud services revenue increased 27% driven by Azure growth of 50%.\n\n\u00b7 Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (\"Windows OEM\") revenue increased slightly.\n\n\u00b7 Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14%.\n\n\u00b7 Xbox content and services revenue increased 23%.\n\n\u00b7 Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, increased 13%.\n\n\u00b7 Surface revenue increased 5%.\n\nOn March 9, 2021, we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. (\"ZeniMax\"), the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC, for a\ntotal purchase price of $8.1 billion, consisting primarily of cash. The purchase price included $768 million of cash and cash equivalents\nacquired. The financial results of ZeniMax have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition.\nZeniMax is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.

Each industry shift is an\nopportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft,\nwe push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address\nthe changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n\n\n### Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\nsoftware and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors\ncustomers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of\ncloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The\ninvestments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating\nmargins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent\nworldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in\nresources, the ability to grow one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\nAggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic.\n\nOur devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are\nvery few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor\nbecomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our\nability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and\nexpenses. Weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies increased reported revenue and did not have a material impact\non reported expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2021.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n\n### COVID-19\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations and financial results. Cloud usage and demand\nbenefited as customers accelerate their digital transformation priorities. Our consumer businesses also benefited from the remote\nenvironment, with continued demand for PCs and productivity tools, as well as strong engagement across our Gaming platform. We saw\nimprovement in customer advertising spend and savings in operating expenses related to COVID-19, but experienced weakness in\ntransactional licensing. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is\nuncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a\ndiscussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n\n### Seasonality\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven\nby corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is\ndriven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"40\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n### Change in Accounting Estimate\n\nIn July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the\nestimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two\nyears to four years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and\nnetwork equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was\nan increase in operating income of $2.7 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.30 per both basic and diluted share.\n\n\n### Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More\nPersonal Computing.

The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due\nto tax benefits from a decision by the India Supreme Court on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence\nPrivate Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\n\nWe have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In\nMarch 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software\nsales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to\nbe not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to\nreflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions\nresulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto\nRico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes.\n\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic\ndistribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0\nbillion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1 billion. In fiscal year 2020, our U.S. income before income taxes was $24.1\nbillion and our foreign income before income taxes was $28.9 billion.\n\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS\nwithdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the\nexamination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax\nyears 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax\nyears 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"47\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our\nconsolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We\nhave not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues\nin the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax\ncontingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for\ntax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected\nto be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n# NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the tax benefits related to the India Supreme\nCourt decision on withholding taxes in fiscal year 2021. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight\ninto our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-\nGAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures\npresented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\n\nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n<th>2020</th>\n<th>Percentage Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income</td>\n<td>$ 61,271</td>\n<td>$ 44,281</td>\n<td>38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes</td>\n<td>(620)</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted net income (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 60,651</td>\n<td>$ 44,281</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diluted earnings per share</td>\n<td>$ 8.05</td>\n<td>$ 5.76</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes</td>\n<td>(0.08)</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP)</td>\n<td>$ 7.97</td>\n<td>$ 5.76</td>\n<td>38%</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\\* Not meaningful.\n\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"48\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n\n# PART II Item 7\n\n\n# FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n\n## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $130.3 billion and $136.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. Equity\ninvestments were $6.0 billion and $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended\nto facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified\namong industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign\ncurrency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit\nrisk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income\nindices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid\ninvestment-grade fixed-income securities.\n\n\n## Valuation\n\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our\nfinancial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and\npreferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value,\nthen we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or\nindirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency\nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3\ninvestments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\n\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide\na quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is\nused mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more\nreflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2\ninvestments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our\nbroker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these\ninvestments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls\ninclude model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices\nwhere appropriate.\n\n\n## Cash Flows\n\nCash from operations increased $16.1 billion to $76.7 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers,\noffset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing increased $2.5 billion to $48.5 billion for fiscal\nyear 2021, mainly due to a $4.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a\n$1.8 billion decrease in repayments of debt and a $1.7 billion decrease in cash premium paid on debt exchange. Cash used in investing\nincreased $15.4 billion to $27.6 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies,\nnet of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, a $5.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $4.1\nbillion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.\n\n\n## Debt\n\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate\nenvironment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things,\nfunding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021\nand June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of\nfavorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment.

Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and\nrecognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in\nadvance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to\nFinancial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2021:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>(In millions)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Three Months Ending</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>September 30, 2021</td>\n<td>$ 15,922</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>December 31, 2021</td>\n<td>12,646</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>March 31, 2022</td>\n<td>8,786</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>June 30, 2022</td>\n<td>4,171</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thereafter</td>\n<td>2,616</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 44,141</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and\nservices, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription\nperiod or upon consumption, as applicable.\n\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nDuring fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 101 million shares and 126 million shares of our common stock for $23.0 billion and\n$19.7 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Refer to Note 16 -\nStockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n## Dividends\n\nRefer to Note 16 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third\nparties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches\nof certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors\nsuch as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These\nobligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"50\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n## Contractual Obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>(In millions)</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n<th>2023-2024</th>\n<th>2025-2026</th>\n<th>Thereafter</th>\n<th>Total</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long-term debt: (a)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Principal payments</td>\n<td>$ 8,075</td>\n<td>$ 8,000</td>\n<td>$ 5,250</td>\n<td>$ 42,585</td>\n<td>$ 63,910</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Interest payments</td>\n<td>1,628</td>\n<td>2,847</td>\n<td>2,438</td>\n<td>17,320</td>\n<td>24,233</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Construction commitments (b)</td>\n<td>8,927</td>\n<td>529</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>9,456</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating leases, including imputed interest (c)</td>\n<td>2,801</td>\n<td>4,956</td>\n<td>3,469</td>\n<td>6,747</td>\n<td>17,973</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finance leases, including imputed interest (c)</td>\n<td>1,341</td>\n<td>3,256</td>\n<td>3,774</td>\n<td>14,096</td>\n<td>22,467</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transition tax (d)</td>\n<td>1,427</td>\n<td>4,105</td>\n<td>8,030</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>13,562</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Purchase commitments (e)</td>\n<td>29,129</td>\n<td>1,708</td>\n<td>446</td>\n<td>270</td>\n<td>31,553</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other long-term liabilities (f)</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>365</td>\n<td>68</td>\n<td>263</td>\n<td>696</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 53,328</td>\n<td>$ 25,766</td>\n<td>$ 23,475</td>\n<td>$ 81,281</td>\n<td>$ 183,850</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n(a) Refer to Note 11 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n(b)\nRefer to Note 7 - Property and Equipment of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n(c)\nRefer to Note 14 - Leases of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n(d)\nRefer to Note 12 - Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n(e)\nAmounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as\nconstruction commitments above.\n\n(f)\nWe have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $14.6 billion from the amounts\npresented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items.\n\n\n## Other Planned Uses of Capital\n\nOn April 11, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. (\"Nuance\") for $56.00 per share in an all-\ncash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance's net debt. The acquisition has been approved by Nuance's shareholders, and\nwe expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing\nconditions.\n\nWe will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as\ncontinue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities,\ndatacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital\nexpenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters,\ncorporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any\nrelated party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity\nor the availability of capital resources.\n\n\n## Liquidity\n\nAs a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nUnder the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in\nyear six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $4.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2021.\nThe remaining transition tax of $13.6 billion is payable over the next five years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026.\n\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to\nbe sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share\nrepurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and\nthereafter for the foreseeable future.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"51\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n# RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nRefer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and\nexpenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the\ncurrent economic environment due to COVID-19. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment\nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n\n\n### Revenue Recognition\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products\nand services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant\njudgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine\nwhether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud\nservice and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency,\nand interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.\nRevenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional\ncharge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine\nwhether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual\nproducts and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may\nuse information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the\nexercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to\nrecognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information\nbecomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n\n### Impairment of Investment Securities\n\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate,\namong other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than\ncost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available\nquantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse\nconditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than\nnot that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in\nother income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate,\nwe may incur future impairments.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"52\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the\ninvestment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic\nbasis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is\ndetermined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\n\n### Goodwill\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our\nreporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for\nimpairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and\nbetween annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating\nperformance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities\nto reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each\nreporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments,\nincluding estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business,\nestimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and\nother factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for\neach reporting unit.\n\n\n### Research and Development Costs\n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has\nbeen established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for\ngeneral release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have\ndetermined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved\nthrough coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is\nincluded in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\n\n\n### Legal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss\ncontingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we\nevaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the\namount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n### Income Taxes\n\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred\ntax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements\nfrom such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\nsettlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is\nrequired in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax\nreturns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"53\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\nThe TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 12 - Income\nTaxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\n\n\n### Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing\noverhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of\ncompletion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers,\nand the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development\nplans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we\nreduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"54\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 7\" -->\n\n\n# STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this\nreport.

PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n\n### Accounting Principles\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (\"GAAP\").\n\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no\nimpact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\n\n\n### Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and\nbalances have been eliminated.\n\n\n### Estimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and\ntiming of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or\npotential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible\nassets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates;\nwhen technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our\nconsolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and\noutcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current\neconomic environment due to COVID-19.\n\nIn July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the\nestimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two\nyears to four years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and\nnetwork equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was\nan increase in operating income of $2.7 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.30 per both basic and diluted share.\n\n\n### Foreign Currencies\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses\nare translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to\nother comprehensive income.\n\n\n### Revenue\n\n\n#### Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\n\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution\napplications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming\nand entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content\nsuch as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales\nfrom online advertising and LinkedIn.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"62\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n#### Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and\nservices, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of\nallowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n\n##### Nature of Products and Services\n\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer.\nCustomers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly\nin the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the\npoint in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily\nbecause the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over\nthe estimated life of the related device or license.\n\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance\n(\"SA\"). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help\ncustomers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with\nSA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive\nbenefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are\nprovided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized\nratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a\nperiod, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and\ninterdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which\nthe cloud services are provided.\n\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn\nthe revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the\noperating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is\nrecognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online\nmarketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service\noffering.\n\n\n##### Significant Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products\nand services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant\njudgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine\nwhether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud\nservice and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency,\nand interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.\nRevenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"63\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that\nare not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of\namounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be\nallocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual\nproducts and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may\nuse information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the\nexercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to\nrecognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information\nbecomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n\n#### Contract Balances and Other Receivables\n\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior\nto invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice\ncustomers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-\npremises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.\n\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services.\nUnearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably\nover the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, Linkedin\nsubscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows 10 post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other\nofferings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue\nduring the period.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In\ninstances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not\ninclude a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable\nways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples\ninclude invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises\nlicenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021 and 2020, other receivables due from suppliers were $965 million and $442 million, respectively, and are included in\naccounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021 and 2020, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.4 billion and $2.7 billion,\nrespectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine\nthe allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"64\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\nActivity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\">(In millions)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n<th>2020</th>\n<th>2019</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, beginning of period</td>\n<td>$ 816</td>\n<td>$ 434</td>\n<td>$ 397</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charged to costs and other</td>\n<td>234</td>\n<td>560</td>\n<td>153</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Write-offs</td>\n<td>(252)</td>\n<td>(178)</td>\n<td>(116)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, end of period</td>\n<td>$ 798</td>\n<td>$ 816</td>\n<td>$ 434</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAllowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\">(In millions)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>June 30,</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n<th>2020</th>\n<th>2019</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts</td>\n<td>$ 751</td>\n<td>$ 788</td>\n<td>$ 411</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other long-term assets</td>\n<td>47</td>\n<td>28</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 798</td>\n<td>$ 816</td>\n<td>$ 434</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nWe record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings\nthrough a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, our financing receivables, net were $4.4 billion\nand $5.2 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-\nterm assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical\nexperience, and other currently available evidence.\n\n\n#### Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer\nthan one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to\nobtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period\nwould have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive\nprograms as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.\n\n\n#### Cost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product\nsupport service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers\n(\"OEM\"), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and\nservices, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of\nconsulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized\nover the estimated lives of the products.\n\n\n#### Product Warranty\n\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is\nrecognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected\nrepair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon\nthe product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days\nto three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the\nsoftware. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as\nnecessary.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"65\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n#### Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related\nexpenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and\nprogramming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software\ncode and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point\nthat technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production.\nOnce technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n\n#### Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related\nexpenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other\nprograms. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2021,\n2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n\n#### Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock units (\"PSUs\"), is measured at the\nfair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair\nvalue of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not\nreceived during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUS is\nrecognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\n\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon\npurchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n\n\n#### Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and\nexpenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported\nas deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will\nnot be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n\n#### Financial Instruments\n\n\n##### Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash\nequivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater\nthan three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities\nbeyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the\ninvestment of cash that is available for current operations.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"66\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.\nChanges in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based\non publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we\nevaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is\nless than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative\nevidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we\nhave plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair\nvalue below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If\nmarket, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair\nvalues are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred\nto as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are\nsufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense),\nnet.\n\n\n##### Derivatives\n\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of\na derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting\ngains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive\nincome and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components\nexcluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other\nincome (expense), net.\n\n\n#### Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which\ninputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three\nlevels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\n\u00b7 Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments\ninclude U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities\ninclude those actively traded on exchanges.\n\n\u00b7 Level 2 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\nthe assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present\nvalue using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward\nand spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency\nsecurities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal\nsecurities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"67\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\u00b7 Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques,\nincluding option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in\ncorporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to\nan impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\n\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are\ndetermined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,\nand discounted cash flow projections.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\n\n#### Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing\noverhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of\ncompletion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers,\nand the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new\ncost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n\n\n#### Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of\nthe estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows:\ncomputer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to four years; buildings and\nimprovements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not\ndepreciated.\n\n\n#### Leases\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, other\ncurrent liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment,\nother current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present\nvalue of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at\ncommencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease\nterms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment\nleases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain\nequipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\n\n\n#### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis\n(May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its carrying value.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"68\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n#### Intangible Assets\n\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit,\nranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances\nthat may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\n\n\n#### Recent Accounting Guidance\n\n\n##### Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance\n\n\n##### Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology\nthat reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit\nloss estimates. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2020. We use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable,\nloans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. We applied a modified retrospective approach through a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. The\nadoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n##### Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\n\n###### Accounting for Income Taxes\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions\nrelated to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of\ndeferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries.\nThe guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates, and clarifies the accounting\nfor transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2021. We have\ncompleted our assessment and concluded that adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\n\n## NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share (\"EPS\") is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the\nperiod. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential\ncommon shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock\noptions and stock awards.\n\nThe components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:\n\n\n### (In millions, except earnings per

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing\nthe economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not\nqualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\n\n### Foreign Currencies\n\nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily\nto maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\n\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that\nare designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign\nexchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\n\nIn the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow\nhedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged included the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.\n\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on\ncertain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\n\n\n### Interest Rate\n\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments\nto effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"73\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average\nmaturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-\ntraded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n\n### Equity\n\nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts.\nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n\n### Credit\n\nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage\ncredit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging\ninstruments and are included in \"Other contracts\" in the tables below.\n\n\n### Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term\nunsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail\nto meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives.\nAs of June 30, 2021, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no\ncollateral was required to be posted.\n\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar

We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We\nhave not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues\nin the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax\ncontingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for\ntax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.

In 2019, the SAMR presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of\nChina's Anti-Monopoly Law.\n\n\n## Product-Related Litigation\n\n\n### U.S. Cell Phone Litigation\n\nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits,\nincluding 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular\nhandsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire\nNokia's Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are\nconsolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal\nCommunications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\"FCC Guidelines\") are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege\nthat their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The\nlawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\n\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs' expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed\nscientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to exclude the plaintiffs' general\ncausation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for\nevaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the\ndefendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental\nexpert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the\nplaintiffs' expert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for January and February of 2022.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"88\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although\nmanagement currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our\nconsolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change\nin the future.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $339 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse\noutcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were\nunfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the\nperiod in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\n\n\n# NOTE 16 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\n\n## Shares Outstanding\n\nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\">(In millions)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n<th>2020</th>\n<th>2019</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, beginning of year</td>\n<td>7,571</td>\n<td>7,643</td>\n<td>7,677</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Issued</td>\n<td>49</td>\n<td>54</td>\n<td>116</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Repurchased</td>\n<td>(101)</td>\n<td>(126)</td>\n<td>(150)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance, end of year</td>\n<td>7,519</td>\n<td>7,571</td>\n<td>7,643</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nOn September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.\nThis share repurchase program commenced in December 2016 and was completed in February 2020.\n\nOn September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.\nThis share repurchase program commenced in February 2020, following completion of the program approved on September 20, 2016, has no\nexpiration date, and may be terminated at any time.

During\nthe periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes,\nIntelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\n\nOur reportable segments are described below.\n\n\n## Productivity and Business Processes\n\nOur Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and\ninformation services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office\nlicensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and\nSkype for Business.\n\n\u00b7 Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer\nServices, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive.\n\n\u00b7 Linkedin, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, Sales Solutions, and Learning Solutions.\n\n. Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP,\nCRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.\n\n\n## Intelligent Cloud\n\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business\nand developers. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related\nClient Access Licenses (\"CALs\"); and GitHub.\n\n\u00b7 Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services.\n\n\n## More Personal Computing\n\nOur More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our\ntechnology. This segment primarily comprises:\n\n\u00b7 Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows\nCommercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows\ncommercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Internet of Things; and MSN advertising.\n\n\u00b7 Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"93\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\u00b7 Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising digital transactions, Xbox Game Pass and other\nsubscriptions, video games, third-party video game royalties, cloud services, and advertising.\n\n\u00b7 Search advertising.\n\nRevenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain\nrevenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the\nsegments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged,\nprices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue\nmethodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple\nsegments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\n\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These\nallocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling,\nshared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and\ncircumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments.\n\nSegment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\">(In millions)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n<th>2020</th>\n<th>2019</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Productivity and Business Processes</td>\n<td>$ 53,915</td>\n<td>$ 46,398</td>\n<td>$ 41,160</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligent Cloud</td>\n<td>60,080</td>\n<td>48,366</td>\n<td>38,985</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More Personal Computing</td>\n<td>54,093</td>\n<td>48,251</td>\n<td>45,698</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 168,088</td>\n<td>$ 143,015</td>\n<td>$ 125,843</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating Income</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Productivity and Business Processes</td>\n<td>$ 24,351</td>\n<td>$ 18,724</td>\n<td>$ 16,219</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligent Cloud</td>\n<td>26,126</td>\n<td>18,324</td>\n<td>13,920</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More Personal Computing</td>\n<td>19,439</td>\n<td>15,911</td>\n<td>12,820</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td>$ 69,916</td>\n<td>$ 52,959</td>\n<td>$ 42,959</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nNo sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2021,\n2020, or 2019.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nJune 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,\n2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report\ndated July 29, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n### Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical\naudit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating\nthe critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"96\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the\nability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements\nthrough its volume licensing programs.\n\nSignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes\nthe following:\n\n\u00b7 Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for\nseparately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.\n\n. The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.\n\n\u00b7 Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable\nconsideration, optional purchases, and free services).\n\n\u00b7 Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold\nseparately.\n\nGiven these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in\ndetermining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:\n\n\u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the\ntiming of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.\n\n. We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.\n\n\u00b7 We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:\n\n\\- Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were\npart of the agreement.\n\n\\- Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.\n\n\\- Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their\naccounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.\n\n\u00b7 We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not\nsold separately.\n\n\u00b7 We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized\nin the financial statements.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"97\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 8\" -->\n\n\n## Income Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements\n\n\n### Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain\nunresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years\nsubsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a\nmaterial impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and\ninclude complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements.\nGiven the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating\nmanagement's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of\nauditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing\nissues included the following:\n\n\u00b7 We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification,\nrecognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related\ninternal controls.\n\n\u00b7 We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by\nmanagement from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n\u00b7 We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including\nan evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n. For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately\nconsidered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax\npositions.\n\n\u00b7 We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and\ncase law, impacted management's judgments.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 29, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1983.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"98\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 9, 9A\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 9.

Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external\npurposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting\nincludes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts\nand expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements\nwould be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to\nprovide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected.\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this\nevaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2021. There were\nno changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of June 30, 2021; their report is included in Item 9A.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"99\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II Item 9A\" -->\n\n\n### REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\n#### To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation\n\n\n##### Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of June 30,\n2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),\nthe consolidated financial statements and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\") as of and for the year\nended June 30, 2021, of the Company and our report dated July 29, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial\nstatements.\n\n\n##### Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control\nover Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based\non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\n\n\n##### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only\nin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 29, 2021\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"100\" -->\n<!-- PageBreak -->\n\n<!-- PageHeader=\"PART II, III Item 9B, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\" -->\n\n\n# ITEM 9B.
